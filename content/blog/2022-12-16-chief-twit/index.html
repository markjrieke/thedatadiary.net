<p>Umm… twitter is a weird place right now. Since <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/27/technology/elon-musk-twitter-deal-complete.html">Elon Musk’s $44 billion deal to take over twitter closed in late October</a>, there have been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/03/technology/twitter-layoffs-elon-musk.html">mass layoffs</a>, a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/11/22/twitter-advertiser-exodus-musk/">floodgate of advertisers leaving the platform</a>, and a <a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/inside-the-twitter-meltdown">near-daily deluge of disasters</a> (for in depth coverage, I recommend visiting <a href="https://www.platformer.news/">Platformer</a>). It feels like the ship is going down, but it’s been pretty funny to watch everything unfold.</p>

<p>Folks who are invested in Tesla may find the situation somewhat less humorous — Tesla’s stock price has dropped 18% over the past month. That’s a lot to lose, but can it really be causally linked to Musk’s antics on twitter?</p>
<p>As it turns out, yes, it can. Following the approach taken by <a href="https://www.alexpghayes.com/post/2020-05-01_elon-musk-send-tweet/">Alex Hayes</a> and <a href="https://fabiandablander.com/r/Causal-Doge.html">Fabian Dablander</a>, we can use the <a href="https://google.github.io/CausalImpact/CausalImpact.html"><code>{CausalImpact}</code></a> package to compare Tesla’s stock price pre/post Musk’s takeover of twitter, using the S&amp;P500 as a synthetic control.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tidyverse)
library(riingo)
library(CausalImpact)

# pull in stock from tiingo
stonks &lt;- 
  bind_rows(
    riingo_prices(&quot;TSLA&quot;), 
    riingo_prices(&quot;SPY&quot;)
  )

# adjust for tesla 3-1 stock split in aug
stonks &lt;- 
  stonks %&gt;%
  select(ticker, date, close) %&gt;%
  mutate(close = if_else(date &lt; lubridate::mdy(&quot;8/25/22&quot;) &amp; ticker == &quot;TSLA&quot;,
                         close/3,
                         close))</code></pre>
<p>Looking at the two tickers side by side, Tesla seems to follow the index’s movement until the takeover.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>stonks %&gt;% 
  mutate(date = lubridate::as_date(date)) %&gt;%
  ggplot(aes(x = date,
             y = close,
             color = ticker)) + 
  geom_line(linewidth = 1) + 
  scale_color_brewer(palette = &quot;Dark2&quot;) + 
  facet_wrap(~ticker, 
             scales = &quot;free_y&quot;,
             ncol = 1) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = lubridate::mdy(&quot;10/27/22&quot;),
             linetype = &quot;dashed&quot;) +
  scale_x_date(labels = scales::label_date(format = &quot;%b&quot;)) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::dollar_format()) +
  theme(legend.position = &quot;none&quot;) +
  labs(title = &quot;STONKS: Tesla&#39;s and S&amp;P500&#39;s daily close over the past year&quot;,
       x = NULL,
       y = NULL,
       caption = &quot;Data from Dec 16, &#39;21 -- Dec 16, &#39;22&quot;)</code></pre>

<p>Plugging this in blindly to <code>CausalImpact()</code> shows that Musk’s twitter antics have had an effect on Tesla’s price.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>stonks &lt;- 
  stonks %&gt;%
  pivot_wider(names_from = ticker,
              values_from = close)

fit &lt;- 
  CausalImpact(
    zoo(cbind(stonks$TSLA, stonks$SPY), stonks$date), 
    stonks$date[c(1, 217)],  # 12/16/21 - 10/26/22
    stonks$date[c(218, 253)] # 10/27/22 - 12/16/22
  )

fit %&gt;% plot()</code></pre>

<p>Prior to Musk’s twitter takeover, Tesla’s shares could be reliably estimated by the S&amp;P500. After the takeover, however, Tesla’s share price has fallen outside of what the model would expect based on S&amp;P500 data. The implied cost to Tesla shareholders is about <strong>$77 per share</strong> on average, though the credible interval could put the true cost anywhere between <strong>$17 and $133 per share</strong>.</p>
<p>This makes pretty strong assumptions — that Musk’s antics don’t affect S&amp;P500 prices and that no other event is influencing Tesla’s price but not the S&amp;P500 price. There’s lot’s more worth digging into in the paper (<a href="https://projecteuclid.org/journals/annals-of-applied-statistics/volume-9/issue-1/Inferring-causal-impact-using-Bayesian-structural-time-series-models/10.1214/14-AOAS788.full">Brodersen, 2015</a>) that <code>{CausalImpact}</code> accompanies. Since this was mostly a quick exploration on a Friday afternoon, however, I’ll leave the additional investigating to the reader. For me, it’s back to watching the site crash and burn.</p>
