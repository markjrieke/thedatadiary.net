<p>As vaccines have become widely available in the US, new COVID cases and deaths have dropped significantly from winter peak, with the 7-day average for both cases and deaths nearing the averages reported during the initial lockdown in the summer of last year (note that, in the chart for the 7-day average of deaths below, the scale is restricted to 15 deaths per million; this cuts off some of the state surges, but shows the US average better than a <a href="https://github.com/markjrieke/thedatadiary/raw/main/2021.05.30-COVID/p3.png">chart with an unedited scale</a>).</p>

<p>According to the US Vaccine Tracker, <a href="https://twitter.com/USVaccineCount">41% of Americans are fully vaccinated</a> as of today. Even more heartening is the fact that the partisan divide regarding vaccine hesitancy, while still existent, <a href="https://twitter.com/gelliottmorris/status/1397579777448550404">is shrinking</a>.</p>
<p>While this is certainly good news about the country as a whole, individual states, counties, and cities may have varying levels of success in curbing the spread of the virus in the local community. The New York Times created a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/covid-cases-deaths-tracker.html">helpful dashboard</a> that lets you look at the spread of the virus on a state, county, or metro area scale.</p>
<p>All this is to say that, while the pandemic is still not (and possibly will never be) a thing of the past, the introduction of vaccines certainly has appeared to help curb the spread.</p>

<h3>Catching Up</h3>
<p>It’s been a while since I’ve written, due to a flurry of weddings and trips. While I had originally hoped to get back onto a regular weekly writing schedule, I will again have to push out the next post until late June, due to some exciting personal news: June 21st, I’ll be starting a new job! I’ll be transitioning from engineering in the oil &amp; gas industry to healthcare analytics, which I’m really excited about! In the meantime, however, there’s a flurry of work to do in my current job to ensure that the person backfilling me is prepared to pick up the projects I’m working on. Hopefully after that, I can get back to a regular schedule.</p>
<p>As always, you can find my work on <a href="https://github.com/markjrieke/thedatadiary/tree/main/2021.05.30-COVID">github</a>.</p>
