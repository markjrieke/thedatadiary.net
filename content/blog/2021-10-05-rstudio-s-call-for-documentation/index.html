<p>In my job, I spend a good amount of time working in the platform setup by our survey vendor, <a href="https://www.qualtrics.com/">Qualtrics</a>. There are some pre-formatted reports that we can send on a recurring basis through Qualtrics, but for one-off or custom reports, I can work with the raw data in R. A few weeks ago, however, I was asked to setup a recurring email to send a customized report to a group of hospital directors each week. While R makes generating the report simple, sending out each week was tedious, as each one needed to be sent separately. Since the reports contain patient information, I couldn’t automate via a third party server like <a href="https://github.com/features/actions">GitHub Actions</a>. I needed a way to localize the automation to my computer.</p>
<p>Luckily enough, I was able to work out a solution! I wrote about it in a submission to <a href="https://community.rstudio.com/t/r-views-call-for-documentation-announcement/110579">RStudio’s 2021 Call for Documentation</a>. You can read my article on <a href="https://community.rstudio.com/t/automated-email-reports-with-r-vba-and-the-task-scheduler-r-views-submission/115807/5">Automated Email Reports with R, VBA, and the Task Scheduler</a> for more detail.</p>

<h3>Some programming notes</h3>
<ul>
<li>I’ve been named one of RStudio Community’s New Users of the Month!</li>
<li>I’ve started working in Rmarkdown for these posts (you can actually view the native file for this post here). This allows me to mix in code and prose in one document &amp; should make the process a bit easier on my end.</li>
<li>I’ve scheduled out posts every two weeks for the rest of the year. I wanted to give myself enough time to work on some longer term projects, so be on the lookout for more in store!</li>
</ul>
