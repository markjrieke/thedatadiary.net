Umm... twitter is a weird place right now. Since [Elon Musk's $44 billion deal to take over twitter closed in late October](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/27/technology/elon-musk-twitter-deal-complete.html), there have been [mass layoffs](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/03/technology/twitter-layoffs-elon-musk.html), a [floodgate of advertisers leaving the platform](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/11/22/twitter-advertiser-exodus-musk/), and a [near-daily deluge of disasters](https://www.platformer.news/p/inside-the-twitter-meltdown) (for in depth coverage, I recommend visiting [Platformer](https://www.platformer.news/)). It feels like the ship is going down, but it's been pretty funny to watch everything unfold.

Folks who are invested in Tesla may find the situation somewhat less humorous --- Tesla's stock price has dropped 18% over the past month. That's a lot to lose, but can it really be causally linked to Musk's antics on twitter?

As it turns out, yes, it can. Following the approach taken by [Alex Hayes](https://www.alexpghayes.com/post/2020-05-01_elon-musk-send-tweet/) and [Fabian Dablander](https://fabiandablander.com/r/Causal-Doge.html), we can use the [`{CausalImpact}`](https://google.github.io/CausalImpact/CausalImpact.html) package to compare Tesla's stock price pre/post Musk's takeover of twitter, using the S&P500 as a synthetic control.  

```{r}
#| eval: false
library(tidyverse)
library(riingo)
library(CausalImpact)

# pull in stock from tiingo
stonks <- 
  bind_rows(
    riingo_prices("TSLA"), 
    riingo_prices("SPY")
  )

# adjust for tesla 3-1 stock split in aug
stonks <- 
  stonks %>%
  select(ticker, date, close) %>%
  mutate(close = if_else(date < lubridate::mdy("8/25/22") & ticker == "TSLA",
                         close/3,
                         close))
```

Looking at the two tickers side by side, Tesla seems to follow the index's movement until the takeover.

```{r}
#| eval: false
stonks %>% 
  mutate(date = lubridate::as_date(date)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = date,
             y = close,
             color = ticker)) + 
  geom_line(linewidth = 1) + 
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Dark2") + 
  facet_wrap(~ticker, 
             scales = "free_y",
             ncol = 1) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = lubridate::mdy("10/27/22"),
             linetype = "dashed") +
  scale_x_date(labels = scales::label_date(format = "%b")) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::dollar_format()) +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(title = "STONKS: Tesla's and S&P500's daily close over the past year",
       x = NULL,
       y = NULL,
       caption = "Data from Dec 16, '21 -- Dec 16, '22")
```

Plugging this in blindly to `CausalImpact()` shows that Musk's twitter antics have had an effect on Tesla's price. 

```{r}
#| eval: false
stonks <- 
  stonks %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = ticker,
              values_from = close)

fit <- 
  CausalImpact(
    zoo(cbind(stonks$TSLA, stonks$SPY), stonks$date), 
    stonks$date[c(1, 217)],  # 12/16/21 - 10/26/22
    stonks$date[c(218, 253)] # 10/27/22 - 12/16/22
  )

fit %>% plot()
```

Prior to Musk's twitter takeover, Tesla's shares could be reliably estimated by the S&P500. After the takeover, however, Tesla's share price has fallen outside of what the model would expect based on S&P500 data. The implied cost to Tesla shareholders is about **\$77 per share** on average, though the credible interval could put the true cost anywhere between **\$17 and \$133 per share**. 

This makes pretty strong assumptions --- that Musk's antics don't affect S&P500 prices and that no other event is influencing Tesla's price but not the S&P500 price. There's lot's more worth digging into in the paper ([Brodersen, 2015](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/annals-of-applied-statistics/volume-9/issue-1/Inferring-causal-impact-using-Bayesian-structural-time-series-models/10.1214/14-AOAS788.full)) that `{CausalImpact}` accompanies. Since this was mostly a quick exploration on a Friday afternoon, however, I'll leave the additional investigating to the reader. For me, it's back to watching the site crash and burn.
