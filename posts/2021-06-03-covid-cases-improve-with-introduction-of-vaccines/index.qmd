As vaccines have become widely available in the US, new COVID cases and deaths have dropped significantly from winter peak, with the 7-day average for both cases and deaths nearing the averages reported during the initial lockdown in the summer of last year (note that, in the chart for the 7-day average of deaths below,  the scale is restricted to 15 deaths per million; this cuts off some of the state surges, but shows the US average better than a [chart with an unedited scale](https://github.com/markjrieke/thedatadiary/raw/main/2021.05.30-COVID/p3.png)).

According to the US Vaccine Tracker, [41% of Americans are fully vaccinated](https://twitter.com/USVaccineCount) as of today. Even more heartening is the fact that the partisan divide regarding vaccine hesitancy, while still existent, [is shrinking](https://twitter.com/gelliottmorris/status/1397579777448550404). 

While this is certainly good news about the country as a whole, individual states, counties, and cities may have varying levels of success in curbing the spread of the virus in the local community. The New York Times created a [helpful dashboard](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/covid-cases-deaths-tracker.html) that lets you look at the spread of the virus on a state, county, or metro area scale. 

All this is to say that, while the pandemic is still not (and possibly will never be) a thing of the past, the introduction of vaccines certainly has appeared to help curb the spread.

### Catching Up

It’s been a while since I’ve written, due to a flurry of weddings and trips. While I had originally hoped to get back onto a regular weekly writing schedule, I will again have to push out the next post until late June, due to some exciting personal news: June 21st, I’ll be starting a new job! I’ll be transitioning from engineering in the oil & gas industry to healthcare analytics, which I’m really excited about! In the meantime, however, there’s a flurry of work to do in my current job to ensure that the person backfilling me is prepared to pick up the projects I’m working on. Hopefully after that, I can get back to a regular schedule.

As always, you can find my work on [github](https://github.com/markjrieke/thedatadiary/tree/main/2021.05.30-COVID).
