Late last year, [Donald Trump officially announced his candidacy for the 2024 presidential election](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/15/trump-news-trump-launches-2024-presidential-campaign-in-a-bid-to-seize-early-momentum.html). To secure the Republican party's nomination, he'll have to best Florida's governor, Ron DeSantis, who, despite not having yet announced his intention to run, is currently viewed as [the only serious challenger to Trump](https://morningconsult.com/2024-gop-primary-election-tracker/) for the nomination.  It's really far too early to be digging into the 2024 presidential election, but pollsters are gonna do what pollsters are gonna do, so we already have a cadre of primary polls comparing Trump to DeSantis. 

[Nathaniel Rakich](https://twitter.com/baseballot) recently wrote an [article](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/desantis-is-polling-well-against-trump-as-long-as-no-one-else-runs/) for [FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/) in which he examined recent Republican presidential primary polls and came to an interesting conclusion. When pollsters ask respondents to choose from a sea of potential primary candidates, Trump easily bests DeSantis. In head-to-head polls, however, DeSantis more often comes up as the front-runner.

This is a classic example of the [spoiler effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vote_splitting#:~:text=The%20spoiler%20effect%20is%20the,both%20or%20several%20to%20win.), in which the presence of alternative candidates on the ballot curbs one candidate's ability to win a plurality of votes against an opposition candidate --- in this case, the alternative candidates draw votes away from DeSantis. [Standard statistical assumptions/rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_of_irrelevant_alternatives#:~:text=The%20independence%20of%20irrelevant%20alternatives,different%20connotation%20in%20several%20contexts.) state that questions with different possible responses should be evaluated separately, and Rakich rightly splits his analysis between the multiway and head-to-head polls. 

From an intuitive sense, however, it *feels like* we should be able to evaluate these different sets of polls jointly. While the set of candidates may differ, they're asking the same sort of question --- which candidate Republican primary voters would like to see as the party's nomination. The only difference in response options is the inclusion or exclusion of alternative candidates to Trump/DeSantis. [With a little nudging](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/602542/multinomial-categorical-models-with-a-variable-number-of-outcomes/602548#602548), however, we may be able to link the two different response scales by first estimating the proportion of respondents who would select an alternative to Trump/DeSantis, then estimating the proportion of these "Other" votes that would go to Trump or DeSantis if forced to make a choice in a head-to-head poll. 

Another way of looking at it: we know that these "Other" votes need to go somewhere when presented with a different response scale. Graphically, our goal is to link the two different response scales by estimating the size of the orange/green arrows below.

Using the [same polls that were included in Rakich's analysis](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/polls) and plunking them into a [model](https://github.com/markjrieke/thedatadiary.net/blob/master/content/blog/2023-01-21-trump-vs-desantis-in-2024-republican-primary-polling/scripts/primary_poll_model.stan) that accounts for the structure above comes to largely the same topline conclusions as Rakich --- when there are many candidates on the ballot Trump handily wins but in head-to-head competitions DeSantis bests Trump.

Alternatively, expressed as a margin, Trump would be expected to beat DeSantis in the primary by 10-13% if there are many candidates on the ballot, while he would expect to lose to DeSantis by 1-5% in a head-to-head matchup.

Again, this is thus far very similar to what Rakich found with a simple average of polls. The benefit of modeling, however, means that we can additionally estimate the proportion of voters who would switch from an alternative to Trump/DeSantis if forced to do so! Of the voters who select other candidates in multiway polls, we expect that somewhere between 80-93% would prefer DeSantis in a head-to-head matchup, with Trump receiving the remaining 7-20%.

Under the hood, this uses [Stan](https://mc-stan.org/) to estimate the model parameters (you can view the full model [here](https://github.com/markjrieke/thedatadiary.net/blob/master/posts/2023-01-21-trump-vs-desantis-in-2024-republican-primary-polling/scripts/primary_poll_model.stan)). This is a bit like using a sledgehammer to put a nail into the wall --- it's a bit overkill. This is a pretty simple model that [could've been estimated analytically](https://github.com/markjrieke/thedatadiary.net/blob/master/posts/2023-01-21-trump-vs-desantis-in-2024-republican-primary-polling/scripts/analytical_est.xlsx), but this was also a good coding exercise that opened the door to building more complicated/useful models with this linked structure in the future. You should take the results with a bit of a grain of salt --- the relatively simple model is probably overconfident in its estimations and there's a lot of time for things to change between now and the 2024 election.
