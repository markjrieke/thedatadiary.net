:::{.alert-warning}
Oh no! this is something that requires me to write out more than a few lines of text at a time. We should look at the following. 

* Notes
* **notes in bold**
* *notes in italics*
* Notes with *latex*: $\phi \sim \text{Normal}(\mu, \sigma)$
:::

:::{.alert-info}
this is a note that's just for information
:::

:::{.alert-primary}
this is the regular ole alert
:::

:::{.alert-light}
this is a more subtle guy
:::

:::{.column-margin}
This is an extensive comment in the margin of the page. I have lots of questions and comments that may sometimes be better suited for the side panel rather than the main panel.

R_i & \sim \text{Multinomial}(n_i, p_i) \\
p_i & = \langle p_1, \ p_2, \ p_3 \rangle

I should problably test out [links to other sites](https://github.com/markjrieke).
