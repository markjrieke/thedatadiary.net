My name is Mark Rieke and I am a data scientist at [Game Data Pros, Inc.](https://gamedatapros.com/) where I help design experiments and analyze test results from a Bayesian perspective. I love making beautiful charts, working on home improvement projects, and playing jazzy piano.

I earned my bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from the [University of Tulsa](https://utulsa.edu/) in 2018. I worked with [Siemens Energy](https://www.siemens-energy.com/us/en.html) for three years desiging mobile gas-turbine power plants before more moving into a more data-centric role at [Memorial Hermann Health System](https://www.memorialhermann.org/), where I worked with survey data to measure and improve patient satisfaction. I currently use [R](https://www.r-project.org/), [Stan](https://mc-stan.org/), and [Python](https://www.python.org/) to build systems for running and analyzing experiments on player behavior. In my spare time, I love analyzing public political datasets. You can find my work on [GitHub](https://github.com/markjrieke) and my unedited stream of consciousness on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/markjrieke). 

I live in Tulsa, OK, with my wife and three obnoxious yet lovable pets.
