I am a data scientist, Bayesian statistician, ML engineer, or whatever the flavor-of-the-day title might be. I currently work as a Senior Data Scientist at [Fortis Games](https://www.fortisgames.com/en-us/) where I build models and systems for optimizing revenue, analyzing experiments, and improving the player experience. In my free time, you can find me doing improv with *Knot Occult* at the [Jackalope Theater](https://www.jackalopetheater.com/).

I live in Tulsa, OK, with my wife and three obnoxious yet lovable pets.
