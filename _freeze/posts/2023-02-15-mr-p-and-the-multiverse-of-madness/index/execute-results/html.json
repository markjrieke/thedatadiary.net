Surveys are great! But the survey sample may not always be representative of the population. When this is the case, we can't take the aggregated survey responses at face value and need to adjust for any bias the non-representativeness. \n\n*Multilevel regression and post-stratification* (which gets re-dubbed as MRP or \"Mr P\") is a super intimidating and stats-y sounding procedure to correct for this bias, but it turns out it's actually not too difficult. MRP is a two step process that involves fitting a multilvel model based (at least in part) on the demographic variables tied to each response, then reweighting so that the sample demographics match the population demographics. Let's run through an example!\n\n# The Setup\n\nLet's suppose that Harris County, TX, is proposing a new law and want to know if residents support it or not. As a part of the survey, they plan to collect data on race. According to [2020 census data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harris_County,_Texas#Demographics), white and hispanic residents make up a majority of the county. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# harris county demographic data (2020, wikipedia)\ndemographics <- \n  tribble(\n    ~race, ~pop,\n    \"white\", 1309593,\n    \"black\", 885517,\n    \"native american\", 8432,\n    \"asian\", 344762,\n    \"pacific islander\", 3199,\n    \"other\", 23262,\n    \"mixed\", 121671,\n    \"hispanic\", 2034709\n  )\n\ndemographics %>%\n  arrange(desc(pop)) %>%\n  mutate(race = str_to_title(race),\n         pop = scales::label_comma()(pop)) %>%\n  rename_with(str_to_title) %>%\n  knitr::kable()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n|Race             |Pop       |\n|:----------------|:---------|\n|Hispanic         |2,034,709 |\n|White            |1,309,593 |\n|Black            |885,517   |\n|Asian            |344,762   |\n|Mixed            |121,671   |\n|Other            |23,262    |\n|Native American  |8,432     |\n|Pacific Islander |3,199     |\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe county plans on sending out the survey randomly. If, however, the different racial groups respond at different rates, they may be over or under-represented in the survey responses. Here, I've set a fake response rate and approval rate for each racial group --- despite making up over 40% of the actual population in Harris county, hispanics will be under-represented in the survey relative to white residents because they respond at a lower rate. White respondents are far less likely to approve of the new law, so the results of the survey will be biased downwards.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# assign demographic weights & parameters\ndemographics <- \n  demographics %>%\n  mutate(pop_rate = pop/sum(pop)) %>%\n  bind_cols(response_rate = seq(from = 0.4, to = 0.2, length.out = nrow(.))) %>%\n  mutate(survey_weight = pop_rate * response_rate,\n         survey_weight = survey_weight/sum(survey_weight)) %>%\n  bind_cols(approval_rate = seq(from = 0.2, to = 0.9, length.out = nrow(.)))\n\ndemographics %>%\n  arrange(desc(pop)) %>%\n  mutate(race = str_to_title(race),\n         pop = scales::label_comma()(pop),\n         across(c(pop_rate:approval_rate), ~scales::label_percent(accuracy = 0.1)(.x))) %>%\n  rename_with(~str_replace(.x, \"_\", \" \")) %>%\n  rename_with(str_to_title) %>%\n  knitr::kable()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n|Race             |Pop       |Pop Rate |Response Rate |Survey Weight |Approval Rate |\n|:----------------|:---------|:--------|:-------------|:-------------|:-------------|\n|Hispanic         |2,034,709 |43.0%    |20.0%         |29.0%         |90.0%         |\n|White            |1,309,593 |27.7%    |40.0%         |37.3%         |20.0%         |\n|Black            |885,517   |18.7%    |37.1%         |23.4%         |30.0%         |\n|Asian            |344,762   |7.3%     |31.4%         |7.7%          |50.0%         |\n|Mixed            |121,671   |2.6%     |22.9%         |2.0%          |80.0%         |\n|Other            |23,262    |0.5%     |25.7%         |0.4%          |70.0%         |\n|Native American  |8,432     |0.2%     |34.3%         |0.2%          |40.0%         |\n|Pacific Islander |3,199     |0.1%     |28.6%         |0.1%          |60.0%         |\n:::\n:::\n\n\nSimulating 1300 responses results in an aggregated result *just* shy of 50%.

However, we don't necessarily need to spend a bunch of time, energy, and resources conducting another survey. Instead, we can use MRP to estimate the overall county support from the non-representative survey data.\n\n# The Execution\n\n## Multilevel regression\n\nThe first stage of MRP is to fit a model to the data. Modeling isn't actually needed for post-stratification, but is useful for estimating average effects. Multilevel models let us pool information across groups (i.e., groups with few responses will get shrunken towards the group mean), and doing so with a Bayesian flavor gives us the added benefit of propogating our prior uncertainty through the model.\n\nIn this case, we're interested in the level of support in the population, $\\pi$. We can estimate $\\pi$ by modeling each individual's probability of approving, $\\pi_i$, based on an average level of support, $\\alpha$, offset by some amount based on the respondent's race, $z_{\\text{race}[i]} \\ \\sigma$. \n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Approval}_i & \\sim \\text{Bernoulli}(\\pi_i) \\\\\n\\text{logit}(\\pi_i) & = \\alpha + z_{\\text{race}[i]} \\ \\sigma \\\\\n\\alpha & \\sim \\text{Normal}(0, 1) \\\\\nz_{\\text{race}} & \\sim \\text{Normal}(0, 0.5) \\\\\n\\sigma & \\sim \\text{Exponential}(1)\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nrids <- \n  surveys %>%\n  distinct(race) %>%\n  arrange(race) %>%\n  bind_cols(rid = seq(1:nrow(.)))\n\nsurveys_stan <- \n  surveys %>%\n  left_join(rids) %>%\n  select(approve, rid) %>%\n  as.list()\n\nset.seed(1997)\nsupport_mod <-\n  ulam(\n    alist(\n      approve ~ dbinom(1, p),\n      logit(p) <- alpha + z[rid]*sigma,\n      alpha ~ dnorm(0, 1),\n      z[rid] ~ dnorm(0, 0.5),\n      sigma ~ dexp(1)\n    ),\n    \n    data = surveys_stan,\n    chains = 4,\n    cores = 4,\n    iter = 1000\n  )\n```\n:::\n\n\nIf we plug into a model, we can estimate the level of support among each racial group. Because this is a multilevel model, we can estimate the level of support among groups for which there are no survey responses using the global average, $\\alpha$ and the prior estimate for $z$. This doesn't tell us a whole lot in this case other than the prior is very uncertain (but this makes sense given how spread out each racial subset is).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# get posterior draws as a tibble\ndraws <- \n  support_mod@stanfit %>%\n  posterior::as_draws_df() %>%\n  as_tibble()\n\nraces <- \n  demographics %>%\n  left_join(rids) %>%\n  select(race, rid)\n\n# pacific islander/other had no responses, so only can use the \n# alpha term from the model for these groups\n# z is estimated from the prior\nset.seed(1996)\nunknown_draws <- \n  draws %>%\n  select(.draw, alpha, sigma) %>%\n  bind_cols(z = rnorm(nrow(.), 0, 0.5))\n  \nunknown_draws <- \n  bind_rows(unknown_draws %>% mutate(race = \"pacific islander\"),\n            unknown_draws %>% mutate(race = \"other\")) \n\n# convert to long format for working with plots\ndraws <- \n  draws %>% \n  select(starts_with(\"z\"), .draw) %>%\n  pivot_longer(starts_with(\"z\"),\n               names_to = \"rid\",\n               values_to = \"z\") %>%\n  mutate(rid = as.integer(str_extract(rid, \"[:digit:]\"))) %>%\n  left_join(draws) %>%\n  select(-starts_with(\"z[\")) %>%\n  left_join(rids) %>%\n  select(.draw, race, z, alpha, sigma) %>%\n  bind_rows(unknown_draws)\n\ndraws %>%\n  mutate(approve = expit(alpha + z*sigma),\n         race = fct_reorder(str_to_title(race), approve)) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = race,\n             y = approve)) +\n  ggdist::stat_slabinterval(alpha = 0.65,\n                            fill = RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(3, \"Dark2\")[3],\n                            breaks = seq(from = 0, to = 1, by = 0.00625),\n                            slab_color = \"white\",\n                            slab_size = 1,\n                            slab_alpha = 0.5,\n                            .width = c(0.5, 0.8),\n                            outline_bars = TRUE) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::label_percent()) + \n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_rieke() +\n  labs(title = \"Racing to Support\",\n       subtitle = \"Estimated level of support for the new law by racial group\",\n       x = NULL,\n       y = NULL,\n       caption = \"Pointrange indicates 50/80%<br>posterior credible interval\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/race plot-1.png){width=2700}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Post-stratification\n\nThe survey's raw estimate for $\\pi$ (even after modeling) is biased, since our survey population is not a good proxy for the county's population.
