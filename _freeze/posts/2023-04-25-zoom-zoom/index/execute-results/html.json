Questions on patient surveys have multiple options to choose from and there can be many possible candidates listed on an election poll. If modeling in [Stan](https://mc-stan.org/), the [multinomial sampling statement](https://mc-stan.org/docs/functions-reference/multinomial-distribution.html#sampling-statement-21) is a natural tool to reach towards first. Multinomial models in Stan, however, *cannot be vectorized*^[Or, if they can, I am wholly unaware], so they can be *very slow* in comparison with other models. This can be pretty frustrating! And throwing more computational resources at the problem can help, but (from my experience), only marginally.\n\n[Andrew Gelman](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/), Bayesian benefactor that he is, has quite a few thoughts on how to address modeling issues. My favorite and most oft cited of which is the *folk theorem of statistical computing*, which states that computational issues are more often than not statistical issues in disguise and the solution is usually statistical, rather than computational.^[Andrew Gelman et. al., \"Bayesian workflow,\" (November 2020), https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2011.01808.] Perhaps unsurprisingly, this advice rings true in this scenario --- this computational conundrum has a particularly satisfying statistical solution. With some (in hindsight, pretty simple) mathematical wizardry, we can rewrite a multinomial as a series of Poisson sampling statements.^[Richard McElreath. *Statistical Rethinking: A Bayesian Course with Examples in R and Stan* (Boca Raton, FL: Chapman & Hall/CRC, 2020), 363-365.] In this case, we're truly getting a free lunch --- this reparameterization provides the *same inference* as the original parameterization at a *far quicker pace!*\n\nTo see this in action, let's simulate some data and fit a few models. The code block below generates a multinomial response matrix, `R`, in which each row represents the number of respondents who have selected from three available categories.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggdist)\nlibrary(riekelib)\n\n# fix category probabilities & simulate number of respondents per row\nset.seed(40)\np <- c(0.2, 0.15, 0.65)\ntotals <- rpois(25, 25)\n\n# simulate responses\nR <- matrix(nrow = 3, ncol = 25)\nfor (i in 1:length(totals)) {\n  R[,i] <- rmultinom(1, totals[i], p)\n}\nR <- t(R)\n\n# preview the first 5 rows\nR[1:5,]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n#>      [,1] [,2] [,3]\n#> [1,]    4    2   21\n#> [2,]    5    3   19\n#> [3,]    4    5   11\n#> [4,]    4    4   18\n#> [5,]    6    3   10\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe can fit a simple model to the data to estimate the probability vector, $\\alpha$, of selecting each category:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nR_i & \\sim \\text{Multinomial}(\\alpha, N_i) \\\\\n\\alpha & \\sim \\text{Dirichlet}(2, 2, 2)\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nIn Stan, we can use the `profile()` function to track the amount of time the model spends in specific sections.^[This is a debugging superpower I only recently discovered and wish I had in my back pocket long, long ago.]\n\n\n::: {.cell output.var='multinomial_likelihood'}\n\n```{.stan .cell-code}\ndata {\n  int N;\n  array[N, 3] int R;\n}\nparameters {\n  simplex[3] alpha;\n}\nmodel {\n  // prior\n  alpha ~ dirichlet(to_vector({2, 2, 2}));\n  \n  // likelihood\n  profile(\"multinomial implementation\") {\n    for (i in 1:N) {\n      R[i,] ~ multinomial(alpha);\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\nWritten as a multinomial, here's how long the model's likelihood takes to sample:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nstan_data <-\n  list(\n    N = nrow(R),\n    R = R\n  )\n\nmultinomial_model <- \n  cmdstanr::cmdstan_model(\"multinomial_likelihood.stan\")\n\nmultinomial_fit <- \n  multinomial_model$sample(\n    data = stan_data,\n    seed = 41,\n    chains = 4,\n    parallel_chains = 4,\n    refresh = 0\n  )\n\n# summarise & save for later\nmultinomial_time <- \n  bind_rows(multinomial_fit$profiles()[[1]],\n            multinomial_fit$profiles()[[2]],\n            multinomial_fit$profiles()[[3]],\n            multinomial_fit$profiles()[[4]]) |>\n  summarise(name = unique(name),\n            total_time = sum(total_time))\n\nmultinomial_time |>\n  mutate(total_time = round(total_time, 2)) |>\n  knitr::kable()\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n|name                       | total_time|\n|:--------------------------|----------:|\n|multinomial implementation |       0.36|\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis is a pretty simple model and doesn't take too long to run, even with `cmdstanr`'s default of 4,000 samples. We can, however, do a bit better. Let's refactor the multinomial with a series of Poisson likelihoods. To quote McElreath, *this should sound a bit crazy.* But the math justifies it! The probability of any individual category can be written in terms of the *expected* number responses for that category, e.g.:\n\n$$\n\\alpha_c = \\frac{\\lambda_c}{\\sum \\lambda}\n$$\n\nThe sum of the expected category values, $\\sum \\lambda$, however, *must* equal the total number of respondents, $N$, so we rewrite each category's expected number of responses, $\\lambda_c$ in terms of the probability $\\lambda_c$:\n\n$$\n\\lambda_c = \\alpha_c N\n$$\n\nThis is the same $\\lambda$ that we usually see in Poisson models --- we'll end up with a separate Poisson model for each possible category (three, in this case). The model can now be written for each row, $i$, and category, $c$.\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nR_{i,c} & \\sim \\text{Poisson}(\\lambda_{i,c}) \\\\\n\\lambda_{i,c} & = \\alpha_cN_i \\\\\n\\alpha & \\sim \\text{Dirichlet}(2, 2, 2)\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\n\n::: {.cell output.var='poisson_likelihood'}\n\n```{.stan .cell-code}\ndata {\n  int N;\n  array[N, 3] int R;\n  vector[N] totals;\n}\nparameters {\n  simplex[3] alpha;\n}\nmodel {\n  // prior\n  alpha ~ dirichlet(to_vector({2, 2, 2}));\n  \n  // likelihood\n  profile(\"poisson implementation\") {\n    for (i in 1:3) {\n      R[,i] ~ poisson(alpha[i]*totals);\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\nThis new parameterization cuts the sampling time roughly in half!\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nstan_data <-\n  list(\n    N = nrow(R),\n    R = R,\n    totals = as.double(totals)\n  )\n\npoisson_model <-\n  cmdstanr::cmdstan_model(\"poisson_likelihood.stan\")\n\npoisson_fit <-\n  poisson_model$sample(\n    data = stan_data,\n    seed = 42,\n    chains = 4, \n    parallel_chains = 4,\n    refresh = 0\n  )\n\npoisson_time <- \n  bind_rows(poisson_fit$profiles()[[1]],\n            poisson_fit$profiles()[[2]],\n            poisson_fit$profiles()[[3]],\n            poisson_fit$profiles()[[4]]) |>\n  summarise(name = unique(name),\n                   total_time = sum(total_time))\n\nbind_rows(multinomial_time, poisson_time) |> \n  mutate(total_time = round(total_time, digits = 2)) |>\n  knitr::kable()\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n|name                       | total_time|\n|:--------------------------|----------:|\n|multinomial implementation |       0.36|\n|poisson implementation     |       0.29|\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis may feel weird --- why did the sampling time *decrease* when we *increased* the number of sampling statements from one to three?^[We did also add an additional multiplication step to convert from $\\alpha$ to $\\lambda$, but the bulk of the time is spent in the sampling.] It all has to do with vectorization! Stan's `poisson()` statement is vectorized, whereas the `multinomial()` statement is not. This means that instead of looping over `N` rows in the dataset, we only need to loop over the `3` categories. \n\nI'd mentioned this before but it's worth repeating: *the benefits of vectorization truly are a free lunch!* We get the same parameter estimates from both models at roughly twice the speed!^[In this toy example, the sampling time roughly halves. In larger, complex models I've built in practice, I've seen sampling times **drop by 75% with a Poisson implementation.**]\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmultinomial_draws <- \n  multinomial_fit$draws(format = \"df\") |> \n  pivot_longer(starts_with(\"alpha\"),\n               names_to = \"variable\",\n               values_to = \"estimate\") |>\n  mutate(model = \"multinomial_implementation\") |>\n  select(model, .draw, variable, estimate)\n\npoisson_draws <- \n  poisson_fit$draws(format = \"df\") |>\n  pivot_longer(starts_with(\"alpha\"),\n               names_to = \"variable\",\n               values_to = \"estimate\") |>\n  mutate(model = \"poisson_implementation\") |>\n  select(model, .draw, variable, estimate)\n\npoisson_draws |>\n  bind_rows(multinomial_draws) |>\n  mutate(side = if_else(model == \"poisson_implementation\", \"top\", \"bottom\")) |> \n  ggplot(aes(x = variable,\n             y = estimate,\n             fill = model,\n             color = model,\n             side = side)) + \n  stat_histinterval(slab_alpha = 0.75,\n                    scale = 0.75,\n                    alpha = 0,\n                    breaks = seq(from = 0, to = 0.75, by = 0.00625)) +\n  scale_y_percent() + \n  MetBrewer::scale_fill_met_d(\"Egypt\") + \n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_rieke() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\") +\n  labs(title = glue::glue(\"**All gas, no brakes**\"),\n       subtitle = glue::glue(\"The \",\n                             \"**{color_text('Poisson model', MetBrewer::MetPalettes$Egypt[[1]][2])}** \",\n                             \"gives the same parameter estimates <br>as the \",\n                             \"**{color_text('Multinomial model', MetBrewer::MetPalettes$Egypt[[1]][1])}** \",\n                             \"at **_twice_** the speed\"),\n       x = NULL,\n       y = NULL,\n       caption = \"Posterior estimates from<br>4,000 MCMC samples\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png){width=2700}\n:::\n:::\n",
