At the time of this writing, it seems overwhelmingly likely that Glenn Youngkin will become the next governor of Virginia. To avoid some of the [galaxy-brain takes that will inevitabely wind up twitter](https://twitter.com/rp_griffin/status/1455696452915802122), I thought I'd distract myself by following up on my previous post. \n\nFirstly, I should share the updated polling average. A few weeks ago, McAullife appeared to have a sizeable lead in the polls:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n```{=html}\n{{% tweet \"1444454926399254535\" %}}\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nHowever, as of election day, the race had significantly tightened to effectively a coin-toss:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n```{=html}\n{{% tweet \"1455164731749175304\" %}}\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAs I mention in the above tweet, the win probability isn't a true forecast, just the portion of each candidate's election day distribution *above 50%*. That being said, actual forecasts similarly had the race down to a near 50-50 split as of this morning:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n```{=html}\n{{% tweet \"1454130028149620737\" %}}\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n```{=html}\n{{% tweet \"1455545666999042056\" %}}\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nEven the model most confident in McAuliffe built by [Lakshya Jain](https://twitter.com/lxeagle17) and [Thorongil](https://twitter.com/Thorongil16) had dropped McAuliffe's win probability from ~85% to 67% over the course of a few weeks:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n```{=html}\n{{% tweet \"1455544487149592576\" %}}\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWhile I definitely plan on utilizing a more scientific poll-weighting methodology in the future, I do find it interesting that even a simple averaging method can produce relatively accurate results in line with the majority of other forecasters. \n\nRegarding post-hoc analysis of *why* McAuliffe lost, I won't dredge up any of my own (partially because it'd be irresponsible & pundit-y to do so without referencing any data and partially because it's getting late & I'm a bit tired), but I'll point out a few tweets from [Nate Cohn](https://twitter.com/Nate_Cohn) that show that the results appear to show a near uniform shift across precincts and different voting groups. This would suggest that McAuliffe's loss is tied more closely to the national environment, rather than shifts amongst specific groups/counties.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n```{=html}\n{{% tweet \"1455693099062153217\" %}}\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n```{=html}\n{{% tweet \"1455717564772986884\" %}}\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis won't stop the networks from ascribing the win/loss to very specific campaign issues (I've already seen quite a few folks ascribe Youngkin's win to education, race, suburban-reversion, etc., without any evidence to back up such claims). Until there are deep dives into data regarding the election, I'd treat any comments from pundits with a hefty grain of salt. \n\n### Some closing thoughts\n\nThat's all for me today! I'll be back in a few weeks with some non-political content, looking at a machine learning model predicting the price of a diamond in the [diamonds dataset](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/diamonds.html). \n\n\n\n{{< tweet juliesquid 1557485909486059523 >}}\n\n",
