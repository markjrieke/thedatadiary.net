Examining the voting records of these republicans who broke with their colleagues shows, unsurprisingly, that they tend to be more supportive of bills protecting democratic (note --- small \"d\") norms.\n\nFiveThirtyEight [developed a democracy index](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-senators-and-representatives-vote-in-favor-of-democracy/) to evaluate how members of congress vote to protect democratic basics and create a more inclusive democracy (higher scores indicate that the congressman/woman is more supportive of bills protecting/expanding democracy). The linked article is well worth reading and walks through the caveats and limitations of the metric, but, notably, house republicans who voted to impeach Donald Trump are on average more supportive of pro-democracy bills than their colleagues who voted to acquit (on bills through September 1st of last year, the day the article was published).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# read in democracy scores\ncomparisons <- \n  read_csv(\"data/democracy_votes.csv\")\n\n# impeachment republicans\nimpeachment_republicans <-\n  c(\"Liz Cheney\", \n    \"Anthony Gonzalez\",\n    \"Jaime Herrera Beutler\",\n    \"John Katko\",\n    \"Adam Kinzinger\",\n    \"Peter Meijer\",\n    \"Dan Newhouse\",\n    \"Tom Rice\",\n    \"Fred Upton\",\n    \"David G.

Biden's presidential approval rating received a slight bump at the onset of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, but the marginal gains since then have faded away and he currently sits at a **-12.6%** net approval.\n\n![](png/generic_ballot_current.png)\n\n![](png/approval_disapproval_current.png)\n\n![](png/net_approval_current.png)",
