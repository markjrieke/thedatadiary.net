But what if we want the best of both worlds: getting a range of predictions while still using a powerful model?

You lay a foundation, setup framing and walls, route mechanical and electrical, then work on final touches like painting and decorating (to be sure, I’m hand-waiving a lot of detail away here). There’s a bit of wiggle room in the order you go about things — you can paint the living room walls before the ones in the bathroom or vice versa — but some steps definitely need to happen before others — you can’t paint either rooms until the walls themselves are actually up!\nThe same logic applies for data science — there are certain activities that are exceptionally hard to do without the proper infrastructure in place. Sometimes, we’re asked to chase after ~shiny objects~ without the support system to do so, when doing so may actually make our job more difficult in the future!\nI recently stumbled across an article that summarized this really succinctly with the following graphic: The Data Science Hierarchy of Needs.\nCollect\rAt a baseline, to do any sort of data work you need to actually have data on hand to work with! Whether there’s a formal process for collecting data or you need to gather data from disparate public sources, getting raw data out of the wild and into your system is the first step to being able to do any sort of analysis. In my case, as an analyst with a hospital’s patient satisfaction group, we need to actually send patients surveys.\n\rMove/Store\rOnce you know where your data is coming from, setting up a reliable data flow from the source to your environment is needed. This is where a lot of headache can come from. Gathering data can be difficult but if the data is going to be used once for a one-off analysis, you don’t need to worry too much about repeatability, edge cases, or computing speed. Once you need to gather new data, thinking about infrastructure around new data gathering becomes much more important. A good chunk of the last eight months of my job has been working with our new survey vendor on this piece of the puzzle: standardizing data layouts, catching bugs in the pipeline, and setting up standards for access.\n\rExplore/Transform\rWith a reliable flow of new/updated data streaming in, you now need to make sure the data is appropriate for general use. Automated anomaly/fraud/bot detection, light wrangling, and removing errant responses can all be considered a part of this single stage. This is necessary to ensure that any analyses you do or models you build are based on what you expect from the underlying data.\n\rAggregate/Label\rI can’t recall the source, but the following quote about data science has stuck with me: “99% of data science work is counting — sometimes dividing.” A significant portion of my day-to-day work involves the tried-and-trusted group_by() %\u0026gt;% summarise() pipeline. Making counts, percentages, running totals, etc. accessible to stakeholders via a dashboard can likely answer ~80% of the questions an analyst would have to field otherwise. It’s so, so important, however, to have the collection, storage, and preparation stages setup prior to ensure that stakeholders can trust that the data they’re seeing is accurate.\n\rLearn/Optimize\rIf 80% of questions asked can be solved with grouped summaries and 20% require a model, it’s likely that 80% of that remaining 20% can be solved by a simple linear model. For example, “What effect does patient age have on their overall satisfaction?” can be answered with lm(satisfaction_score ~ age). As relationships become more complex, you can add more terms to the model, or switch model architectures, but — in my own experience — the majority of modeling in practice can be represented by linear models (and, by extension, regularized models via {glmnet}).\n\rComplex Models\rFinally, a small subset of problems may require a more complex or powerful model type. But before you spin your wheels building a neural net or some other wacky architecture, you should first check if something simpler gets you what you need.\n\rSome Closing Thoughts\rThis post is partially meant to be able to share some useful info and partially a reminder to me to look for the simple solution! I have a tendency to start off with something complex then realize that I could save a lot of work if I just switch to something simpler. The three baseline layers upstream of my domain are super important and definitely need oversight from someone with an eye for data engineering.\n\rPolling Bites\rThe generic congressional ballot is starting to show some movement away from even split as Republicans have slowly climbed to 51.2% in the polls and Democrats have fallen to 48.8%.\nBiden’s net approval hasn’t shifted significantly since the last post — currently sitting at 10.9% underwater with 41.8% approval and 52.7% disapproval.\n(p.s., I’ve updated the color palettes here with the {MetBrewer} package, which provides colorblind friendly palettes based on artwork in hte Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York).\n\r","date":1645488000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1645584987,"objectID":"ec9ca9ed9342c4de69bd8eae2a83c234","permalink":"https://www.thedatadiary.net/blog/2022-02-22-the-data-science-hierarchy-of-needs/","publishdate":"2022-02-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/2022-02-22-the-data-science-hierarchy-of-needs/","section":"blog","summary":"I’ve never built a house (shocking, I know), but from far too much time spent watching HGTV, I understand the basic gist of it.

Since the release of that package, I’ve discovered some errors with the methodology described here and would recommend instead referencing the post associated with the release.\nStatistical modeling sometimes presents conflicting goals. Oftentimes, building a model involves a mix of objectives that don’t necessarily mesh well together: super-accurate point predictions, explainability, fast performance, or an expression of confidence in the prediction. In my work as an analyst, I generally am focused on how explainable the model is while being able to express a confidence interval around each prediction. For that, simple linear models do the trick. If, however, I want to regularize via {glmnet} (which — with good reason — doesn’t provide confidence intervals) or use a non-linear model like {xgboost}, I have to drop the confidence interval around predictions. Or so I had previously thought! As it turns out, building a series of models from bootstrap resamples provides an alternative method of generating a confidence interval around a prediction.\nSetting a baseline with penguins\rFirst, let’s build out a baseline linear model with the Palmer Penguins dataset. This dataset contains information on 344 penguins across three species types and three islands. For this example, we’ll use the penguin information to predict body_mass_g.\n# load the data in from the tidytuesdayR package\rpenguins_src \u0026lt;- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(2020, week = 31)\r## ## Downloading file 1 of 2: `penguins.csv`\r## Downloading file 2 of 2: `penguins_raw.csv`\r# extract out the penguins dataset\rpenguins \u0026lt;- penguins_src$penguins\rrm(penguins_src)\rpenguins\r## # A tibble: 344 x 8\r## species island bill_length_mm bill_depth_mm flipper_length_mm body_mass_g\r## \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;\r## 1 Adelie Torgersen 39.1 18.7 181 3750\r## 2 Adelie Torgersen 39.5 17.4 186 3800\r## 3 Adelie Torgersen 40.3 18 195 3250\r## 4 Adelie Torgersen NA NA NA NA\r## 5 Adelie Torgersen 36.7 19.3 193 3450\r## 6 Adelie Torgersen 39.3 20.6 190 3650\r## 7 Adelie Torgersen 38.9 17.8 181 3625\r## 8 Adelie Torgersen 39.2 19.6 195 4675\r## 9 Adelie Torgersen 34.1 18.1 193 3475\r## 10 Adelie Torgersen 42 20.2 190 4250\r## # ... with 334 more rows, and 2 more variables: sex \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt;, year \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;\rWe’ll need to do some lite preprocessing before we start modeling — it looks like there are some NAs in body_mass_g and in sex.

It looks like the Gentoo and Chinstrap species are only found on the Biscoe and Dream islands, respectively, whereas the Adelie species can be found on all three islands. At first glance, there’s not a meaningful difference that Island has on the weight of the Adelie penguins, so I think we’re safe to toss out the island feature and just keep species.\n# how does sex relate to body mass?\rpenguins %\u0026gt;%\rggplot(aes(x = sex,\ry = body_mass_g,\rcolor = sex)) +\rgeom_boxplot() +\rgeom_point(alpha = 0.25,\rposition = position_jitter())\rUnsurprisingly, male penguins are typically heavier than female penguins.\n# are penguins getting heavier or lighter as years progress?\rpenguins %\u0026gt;%\rmutate(year = as.character(year)) %\u0026gt;%\rggplot(aes(x = year,\ry = body_mass_g)) +\rgeom_boxplot() +\rgeom_point(alpha = 0.25,\rposition = position_jitter())\rIt doesn’t look like there is significant signal being drawn from year, so we’ll toss that out as well.\n# how do other body measurements compare with the total body mass?\rpenguins %\u0026gt;%\rselect(bill_length_mm:body_mass_g) %\u0026gt;%\rpivot_longer(ends_with(\u0026quot;mm\u0026quot;),\rnames_to = \u0026quot;measurement\u0026quot;,\rvalues_to = \u0026quot;value\u0026quot;) %\u0026gt;%\rggplot(aes(x = value,\ry = body_mass_g,\rcolor = measurement)) +\rgeom_point(alpha = 0.5) + facet_wrap(~measurement, scales = \u0026quot;free_x\u0026quot;) +\rgeom_smooth(method = \u0026quot;lm\u0026quot;,\rse = FALSE)\rFor bill and flipper length, there’s a pretty clear relationship, but it looks like bill depth has a classic case of Simpson’s paradox. Let’s explore that further to find a meaningful interaction to apply.\n# which feature interacts with bill depth to produce simpson\u0026#39;s pardox?\rpenguins %\u0026gt;%\rggplot(aes(x = bill_depth_mm,\ry = body_mass_g,\rcolor = species)) +\rgeom_point(alpha = 0.5) +\rgeom_smooth(method = \u0026quot;lm\u0026quot;,\rse = FALSE)\rSo, very clearly, the Gentoo species has a very different relationship between bill depth and body mass than the Adelie/Chinstrap species. We’ll add this as an interactive feature to the model.\nWith all that completed, let’s (finally) setup and build the baseline linear model with confidence intervals around the prediction!\n# remove features\rpenguins \u0026lt;- penguins %\u0026gt;%\rselect(-island, -year)\r# split into testing and training datasets\rset.seed(123)\rpenguins_split \u0026lt;- initial_split(penguins)\rpenguins_test \u0026lt;- testing(penguins_split)\rpenguins_train \u0026lt;- training(penguins_split)\r# setup a pre-processing recipe\rpenguins_rec \u0026lt;- recipe(body_mass_g ~ ., data = penguins_train) %\u0026gt;%\rstep_dummy(all_nominal()) %\u0026gt;% step_interact(~starts_with(\u0026quot;species\u0026quot;):bill_depth_mm)\r# fit a workflow\rpenguins_lm \u0026lt;- workflow() %\u0026gt;%\radd_recipe(penguins_rec) %\u0026gt;%\radd_model(linear_reg() %\u0026gt;% set_engine(\u0026quot;lm\u0026quot;)) %\u0026gt;%\rfit(penguins_train)\r# predict on training data with confidence intervals\rbind_cols(penguins_lm %\u0026gt;% predict(penguins_train),\rpenguins_lm %\u0026gt;% predict(penguins_train, type = \u0026quot;conf_int\u0026quot;, level = 0.95),\rpenguins_train) %\u0026gt;%\rggplot(aes(x = body_mass_g,\ry = .pred)) +\rgeom_point(alpha = 0.5) +\rgeom_segment(aes(x = body_mass_g,\rxend = body_mass_g,\ry = .pred_lower,\ryend = .pred_upper),\ralpha = 0.25) +\rlabs(title = \u0026quot;Predicting the Palmer Penguins - Training\u0026quot;,\rsubtitle = \u0026quot;Linear model predicting a penguin\u0026#39;s weight in grams\u0026quot;,\rx = \u0026quot;Actual weight (g)\u0026quot;,\ry = \u0026quot;Predicted weight (g)\u0026quot;,\rcaption = \u0026quot;Errorbars represent the a 95% confidence interval\u0026quot;) +\rtheme(plot.title.position = \u0026quot;plot\u0026quot;)\rThis model does generally okay, but the confidence interval around each prediction is pretty clearly too confident! Let’s solve this with bootstrapping.\n\rWhat’s a bootstrap?\rBefore progressing any further, it’s probably important to define what exactly a bootstrap is/what bootstrapping is. Bootstrapping is a resampling method that lets us take one dataset and turn it into many datasets. Bootstrapping accomplishes this by repeatedly pulling a random row from the source dataset and, importantly, bootstrapping allows for rows to be repeated! Let’s look at an example for a bit more clarity.\n\r\rrowid\rx1\rx2\r\r\r\r1\r0.8\r104\r\r2\r0.7\r102\r\r3\r0.9\r88\r\r4\r0.4\r124\r\r5\r0.3\r79\r\r\r\rLet’s say we want to make bootstrap resamples of this dataset. We’ll draw five random rows from the dataset and, sometimes, we’ll have the same row show up in our new bootstrapped dataset multiple times:\n\r\rrowid\rx1\rx2\r\r\r\r1\r0.8\r104\r\r3\r0.9\r88\r\r4\r0.4\r124\r\r4\r0.4\r124\r\r2\r0.7\r102\r\r\r\rAnother bootstrap dataset might look like this:\n\r\rrowid\rx1\rx2\r\r\r\r2\r0.7\r102\r\r3\r0.9\r88\r\r5\r0.3\r79\r\r3\r0.9\r88\r\r5\r0.3\r79\r\r\r\rBootstrap datasets allow us to create many datasets from the original dataset and evaluate models across these bootstraps. Models that are well informed will give similar outputs across each dataset, despite of the randomness within each dataset, whereas less confident models will have a wider variation across the bootstrapped datasets.\n\rGenerating some confident penguins\rLet’s say we want to use {xgboost} to predict penguin weight and we’ll use bootstrapping to generate a confidence interval. Firstly, we’ll create the bootstrap datasets from our training set.\npenguins_boot \u0026lt;- penguins_train %\u0026gt;% bootstraps()\rpenguins_boot\r## # Bootstrap sampling ## # A tibble: 25 x 2\r## splits id ## \u0026lt;list\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; ## 1 \u0026lt;split [249/92]\u0026gt; Bootstrap01\r## 2 \u0026lt;split [249/90]\u0026gt; Bootstrap02\r## 3 \u0026lt;split [249/91]\u0026gt; Bootstrap03\r## 4 \u0026lt;split [249/87]\u0026gt; Bootstrap04\r## 5 \u0026lt;split [249/98]\u0026gt; Bootstrap05\r## 6 \u0026lt;split [249/84]\u0026gt; Bootstrap06\r## 7 \u0026lt;split [249/91]\u0026gt; Bootstrap07\r## 8 \u0026lt;split [249/95]\u0026gt; Bootstrap08\r## 9 \u0026lt;split [249/94]\u0026gt; Bootstrap09\r## 10 \u0026lt;split [249/86]\u0026gt; Bootstrap10\r## # ... with 15 more rows\rBy default, the bootstraps() function will create 25 bootstrap datasets, but we could theoretically create as many as we want.

Importantly, we’ve used bootstrap resampling to generate a confidence interval from a model that otherwise normally returns a simple point prediction.\n\rSome noteworthy caveats\rThe prediction interval above is all well and good, but it comes with some hefty caveats. Firstly, the confidence interval in the Testing plot is generated from the mean and standard deviation from each prediction. This assumes that the predictions are distributed normally, which may not necessarily be the case.\ntraining_preds %\u0026gt;%\rslice_head(n = 1) %\u0026gt;%\rpivot_longer(starts_with(\u0026quot;pred\u0026quot;)) %\u0026gt;%\rggplot(aes(x = value)) +\rgeom_density()\rThis density plot for one of the predictions shows that there’s definitely some non-normal behavior! There’s a few ways of addressing this.\nCreate many, many, more bootstraps and models so that the prediction distribution approaches normality (with only 25 points, we really shouldn’t even expect normality from this example).\rReport out the actual values of the percentiles in the distribution (e.g., the 2.5% percentile is below X, 97.5% is above Y, and the mean is at Z).\rReport out the actual distribution as the result.\r\rIdeally, you should do all three.\nThe second major caveat is that this is not one model, but a whole host of models and these take up a large amount of disk space. In this example, our 25 models take up 25 times more space than our original model and it takes some time to read in, fit, and wrangle the results. We can trade disk space for computation time by writing a function that fits and predicts without saving a model, but again, that’s a tradeoff between speed and space. For linear models, it may be a better route to have STAN simulate thousands of results via {rstanarm} or {brms}, but for non-linear models, boostrapping is the best way to go for now!\n\rPolling Bites\rCurrently, the Generic Ballot is holding steady with a slight sliver more Americans wanting Republicans in Congress than Democrats (50.7% to 49.3%, respectively).

I spend a lot of time thinking about what’s coming down the pipeline and how much further I have to go on projects that I have planned, but it’s worthwhile every now and then to take a look back and see just how far I’ve come.\nSome accomplishments I’m proud of\rLearning R\rA year ago, I couldn’t write a lick of R code — I lived and breathed Excel, and was a bit afraid of the transition from a GUI to an IDE. Now, I’d consider myself pretty well-versed in the language and am so glad I made the switch. Having moved to R, I realized how restrictive Excel was — R (or any other analytics-focused programming language) allows for the freedom of expression needed for any sort of serious analysis. This talk by Hadley Wickham was instrumental in pushing me to pick up R and is well worth a watch if you have the time.\n   \rCompleting Stanford’s Machine Learning course\rWhen I started learning R, I was most interested in getting to the point where I’d be able to implement machine learning models (this specifically came from reading the documentation for The Economist’s POTUS model and wanting to understand what was going on under-the-hood). Stanford’s online Machine Learning course was a thorough, technical introduction to the basics of machine learning. It doesn’t cover every model type, but gives a great foundation for how to understand new models by requiring that you write the models yourself (this was very useful and practical, but you won’t catch me using MATLAB anytime soon!).\n\rCommitting to rOpenSci\rrOpenSci is a non-profit initiative committed to creating and maintaining a variety of open-source R packages. For work, I use one of their packages, the qualtRics package, almost daily for extracting survey responses from Qualtrics’ API. I added a small function, fetch_id(), that allows you to pull in survey responses based on the survey’s name, rather than looking up the miscellaneous string of numbers that constitute the survey_id. It’s a small helper function, but working on it taught me a lot about documentation, testing, package development, and contributing to open-source software.\nlibrary(dplyr)\rlibrary(qualtRics)\rall_surveys() %\u0026gt;% fetch_id(\u0026quot;Mark\u0026#39;s Example Survey\u0026quot;) %\u0026gt;%\rfetch_survey() %\u0026gt;%\rknitr::kable()\r## | | | 0%\r| |======================================================================| 100%\r\r\r\rStartDate\rEndDate\rStatus\rIPAddress\rProgress\rDuration (in seconds)\rFinished\rRecordedDate\rResponseId\rRecipientLastName\rRecipientFirstName\rRecipientEmail\rExternalReference\rLocationLatitude\rLocationLongitude\rDistributionChannel\rUserLanguage\rQ1\r\r\r\r2022-01-12 15:20:31\r2022-01-12 15:20:38\rSurvey Preview\rNA\r100\r7\rTRUE\r2022-01-12 15:20:40\rR_XFVjzAh4MalrLmF\rNA\rNA\rNA\rNA\r29.73351\r-95.5564\rpreview\rEN\rStrongly agree\r\r\r\r\rPutting together a developer package\rAt some point this past year, I found myself either re-writing the same chunks of code repeatedly or re-defining functions across every project. After a lengthy period of hesitation, I finally picked up the R Packages book by Hadley Wickham and Jenny Bryan and put together my own personal package, {riekelib}. It’s just a collection of small helper functions that I use regularly for both personal and professional projects, but it’s really helped speed up workflows, since I can just load the library rather than re-write code or functions! Here are a few examples:\nlibrary(riekelib)\r# beta_interval() gives lower \u0026amp; upper bounds of a beta distribution\u0026#39;s confidence interval tibble::tibble(alpha = c(85, 100),\rbeta = c(15, 500)) %\u0026gt;%\rbeta_interval(alpha, beta) %\u0026gt;%\rknitr::kable()\r\r\ralpha\rbeta\rci_lower\rci_upper\r\r\r\r85\r15\r0.7741265\r0.9126452\r\r100\r500\r0.1379480\r0.1974895\r\r\r\r# percent() returns the percentage each value or combination of values appear in a tibble\riris %\u0026gt;%\rtibble::as_tibble() %\u0026gt;%\rpercent(Species) %\u0026gt;%\rknitr::kable()\r\r\rSpecies\rpct\r\r\r\rsetosa\r0.3333333\r\rversicolor\r0.3333333\r\rvirginica\r0.3333333\r\r\r\r\r\rPlots across the year\rPossibly the most visually-engaging way to track growth throughout the past year is to look back on how different plots have evolved. Here’s a walkthrough of some choice plots that I’ve made throughout the year.\nBaby Steps\rThe first plot I ever created in R, made with base R’s plot() function, compares speed \u0026amp; distance from the cars dataset. There’s not really anything visually compelling here, but it gives the starting point.\n\rR, ggplot2, and plotly\rThis next plot shows my first attempt at creating a ggplot. I remember struggling a lot with this when trying to learn the ins and outs of putting together and formatting the plot, but that struggle was well worth it. I learned not only the basics of how to put together a plot with ggplot, but also, more importantly, how to search and troubleshoot issues. I also like that I was able to explore a topic visually with this plot: while the winner of the presidential election overperforms in the electoral college relative to the popular vote, republican candidates consistently have a slightly stronger electoral college overperformance due to small-state bias.\n\r(Kind of) Projecting the 2020 Election\rI started playing around with custom themes, and even setup my own theme elements so that I could reference them easily. This was the first time I broke away from the default theme for ggplot. Additionally, this was the first time I used any sort of statistical methods to make a projection. The projection itself is pretty bad/underconfident, but the methodology was sound.\n\rDoug Collins Saved Raphael Warnock’s Senate Bid\rOf all the posts I wrote in 2021, this may be the one I’m most proud of. Firstly, I learned a lot of new techniques needed to create maps and animations in R, but I also made a data-backed point: Raphael Warnock, one of the current Democratic senators from Georgia, likely won his election because Republican voters split their ticket between Kelly Loeffler and Doug Collins.\n\raRtwork!\rThis next one is just fun, but I used R to make some artwork! I liked it so much, that I ended up making this my site header.\n\rTidymodels and the Titanic\rI spent a lot of time this past year learning how to implement machine learning methods, but eventually got to the point where I feel confident building and troubleshooting models with the tidymodel framework. I had an “aha” moment when working on a classifier for everyone’s favorite dataset, the Titanic survival dataset, and everything finally clicked. The model wasn’t great, but being able to quickly build and iterate was game-changing.\n\rDiamonds are Forever: Feature Engineering with the Diamonds Dataset\rWith some machine learning under my belt, I spent some time practicing feature engineering with the diamonds dataset. From the variable importance plot, I found that some of the engineered features were among the most important for predicting a diamond’s price!\n\rDo Voters Want Democrats or Republicans in Congress?\rMost recently, I created a congressional ballot aggregator that weights polls by pollster, recency, sample size, and methodology. This was a huge effort to create a custom regression methodology, and I’m very happy with how it turned out! As of today, voters are just about even-split between Democrats and Republicans in the upcoming 2022 midterms.\n\r\rPlans for 2022\rI think I’ve come a long way in 2021 and I hope that in 2023, I can look back on 2022 and see a similar level of growth throughout the year. Here are a few things I plan on working on this year:\n\rWriting: I’ve spent a lot of time in 2021 working on technical skills, but haven’t really taken time to work on my writing. This will be an important focus for me in 2022, since technical information is useless if I’m not able to communicate it well.\rBringing ML projects to the office: In my current job, we’ve been spending the majority of the last six months focusing on troubleshooting the errors and getting over the speed-bumps involved with changing our primary survey vendor. We haven’t had the bandwidth to work on higher level/higher value projects, but should be able to do so in the upcoming year. Some projects I’m excited to work on this year include:\r\rVariable importance in predicting positive sentiment in surveys;\rPatient segmentation with k-means clustering;\rShiny App - “How confident am I?” - for educating our non-technical counterparts on confidence intervals vs. point estimates;\rUsing NLP for predicting positive sentiment from patient comments;\rTopic modeling from comments for easier comment segmentation.\r\rNatural Language Processing: As alluded to above, I’d like to work with text data for predictive analysis this year — there’s a lot of valuable insight that can be drawn from text data once I understand how to extract it!\rEnrolling in a Master’s of D.S. program: While I’ve been able to pick up a lot of knowledge from free/low-cost resources online (as well as spending countless hours on StackOverflow), I believe it’s time to further my formal education by pursuing a Master’s of Data Science part-time. Enrolling in a master’s program should help improve both my technical and non-technical skills, as well as formalize my transition from engineering to data science with a degree.\rForecasting the 2022 Midterms: A long-term goal since starting this blog was to learn how to and ultimately deploy a forecast model for the 2022 midterms. I believe I’m well on my way, and hope to be able to publish midterm forecast models for the House, Senate, and Gubernatorial races sometime in the summer this year.\r\rAll-in-all, I’ve got a lot on my plate for 2022, but I’m confident that I’ll be able to tackle the challenges that come my way this year! My schedule is in a good place — full but manageable. As a preview of the next post I have scheduled, here’s a model I built to estimate Biden’s approval:\n\r","date":1641945600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1641996995,"objectID":"c9a4fabd7c5bc89b496647db5ff2a1b3","permalink":"https://www.thedatadiary.net/blog/2022-01-12-the-data-diary-year-in-review/","publishdate":"2022-01-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/2022-01-12-the-data-diary-year-in-review/","section":"blog","summary":"In the year since I started this blog, there’s been a lot that’s happened: I learned to use R, picked up the basics of machine learning, and moved into a new job/industry.","tags":[],"title":"The Data Diary: Year in Review","type":"blog"},{"authors":[],"categories":["politics"],"content":"\r\rThe 2022 midterms are still quite a ways away, however, in order to have a forecast ready in time, I need to start working on the model well in advance! One of the features I plan on using in the House Forecast is the generic congressional ballot average. Generic ballot polls ask respondents whether they intend to vote for either the Republican or Democratic candidate for the U.S. House of Representatives in their district. FiveThirtyEight provides a daily updating polling average, but in order to project beyond their current day’s average, I needed to build my own poll aggregator! Thankfully, they also are kind enough to provide the underlying polling data as well.\nIn this post, I’ll walk through the steps taken to build the generic ballot aggregator and explore the results.\nThe Gameplan\rFiveThirtyEight’s data only goes back for two election cycles, which doesn’t provide enough data to build a poll aggregator from scratch. However, because they also provide their historical trendline, I can build a poll aggregator that fits the polling results to their historical trend.\nIn addition to the topline result, each poll in FiveThirtyEight’s repository includes quite a bit of additional meta-information about the poll: the pollster, sample size, survey methodology, and recipient population. Some pollsters, methodologies, and populations tend to be more accurate than others, so I’d be remiss to not include these features in the polling model. To incorporate all of this information, each feature will be weighted according to how well it fits FiveThirtyEight’s historical average. I’m sweeping a lot of programmatic detail under the rug here, but in general, features that fit FiveThirtyEight’s trendline well will have a higher weight and features that don’t fit the trendline so well will have a lower weight. Finally, since we know that some pollsters tend to favor one party, we’ll also create a “pollster offset” feature to shift each poll slightly and account for this partisan lean.\nBefore digging any further, it may be beneficial to explore the polling repository a bit. Here’s a sample of the polling data used for the aggregator:\n\r\rcycle\rpollster\rsample_size\rpopulation\rmethodology\rend_date\rdem\rrep\r\r\r\r2018\rHarrisX\r3861\rlv\rOnline\r2011-02-18\r48.0\r42.0\r\r2018\rSurveyMonkey\r9532\ra\rOnline\r2010-07-18\r43.0\r42.0\r\r2020\rYouGov\r1200\rrv\rOnline\r2012-03-19\r47.0\r41.0\r\r2018\rIpsos\r731\rlv\rOnline\r2009-06-18\r49.9\r38.6\r\r2020\rHarrisX\r3000\rrv\rOnline\r2010-07-19\r43.0\r36.0\r\r2018\rIpsos\r2383\ra\rOnline\r2009-01-17\r36.8\r31.3\r\r2018\rIpsos\r663\rlv\rOnline\r2006-05-17\r38.7\r32.6\r\r2018\rMorning Consult\r1992\rrv\rOnline\r2005-05-18\r42.0\r35.0\r\r2018\rIpsos\r1689\rrv\rOnline\r2007-03-18\r41.4\r36.5\r\r2018\rIpsos\r1907\ra\rOnline\r2004-02-18\r38.0\r30.3\r\r\r\rThe following pollsters conducted enough polls to warrant their own category - all other pollsters will be lumped together under the banner of “Other Pollster:”\n\r\rpollster\rn\r\r\r\rIpsos\r1239\r\rHarrisX\r426\r\rMorning Consult\r305\r\rYouGov\r195\r\rUSC Dornsife\r71\r\rThe Winston Group\r44\r\rMcLaughlin \u0026amp; Associates\r34\r\rFirehouse Strategies/Øptimus\r32\r\rRasmussen Reports/Pulse Opinion Research\r30\r\rQuinnipiac University\r28\r\r\r\rHere is a bit of expanded detail on the survey population categories:\n\r\rpopulation\rpopulation_full\rn\r\r\r\rrv\rRegistered Voters\r1510\r\rlv\rLikely Voters\r619\r\ra\rAdults\r602\r\rv\rVoters\r2\r\r\r\rFinally, the top survey methodologies considered are shown below.

As time progresses, we make smaller and smaller updates to the weights and offsets we hone in on optimal values for minimizing error.\n\rExploring the Results\rFirst and foremost, I’m pleased to report that the model fit the historical data fairly well. The model’s trendline (in blue) reasonably matches FiveThirtyEight’s historical trendline (in red):\nAs expected, as the model trains the weights and offsets, the rmse continues to shrink, and levels off just after 150 training rounds:\nSome pollsters are better at fitting the trendline: YouGov polls end up with the highest weight in the model whereas Morning Consult polls are downweighted.\nWhat are the partisan leanings of each pollster? Each pollster offset is shown below - pollsters at the top are generally more conservative leaning pollsters near the bottom are generally more liberal leaning. Or rather, pollsters near the top fit the trend better when we adjust their results to favor democrats, and pollsters near the bottom fit better when adjusted in favor of republicans.\nSome pollsters have fairly significant offsets! It’s reassuring to note, however, that these pollsters are downweighted and don’t make up the majority of polls recorded. The five pollsters with the most number of generic ballot polls conducted tend to fall fairly close to 0-offset.\nAlthough live phone polling has become more and more difficult in recent years, it still ended up being the top-weighted method for the generic ballot poll.\nFinally, surveying a population of registered voters turned out to be best for matching polls to the trendline, whereas the “voters” population was filtered away entirely (though that may be because there were only two polls conducted with this population).\n\rFitting to New 2022 Data\rThis exploration of how the model fits to the training data is useful, but how well does this model fit to new data? As it turns out, fairly well! When fit to data it wasn’t trained on, the model’s trendline (in blue) closely follows the target trendline (in red).\nThis also gives us the ability to project beyond the current average! As we get further and further away from the current day, our confidence interval around the current average widens out.\nThis behavior looks great! One area of concern, however, is the area on the left - on days where we already have data, we’re way too confident in our estimate! On some days, the confidence interval only spans 0.5%, which simply isn’t realistic.\nTo deal with this, we’ll create a new feature, downweight, that we can train to widen our confidence interval to something more credible.\n\rOne More Round of Training\rSimilar to training the generic ballot average, we can train the downweight feature to match the model’s confidence interval to FiveThirtyEight’s confidence interval. The trained result isn’t a perfect fit, but this does give us a mathematically sound, consistent way to construct a more realistic confidence interval. Here’s how the model’s confidence interval compares to the training set:\nOn new data, the model similarly provides an okay-enough fit for our purposes. The model may find it difficult to recreate FiveThirtyEight’s confidence interval due to differences in model construction. According to FiveThirtyEight’s documentation on other polling averages, it looks like they use an ensemble of LOESS models, whereas I generate a single beta distribution. Without getting too far into the weeds, the stack of LOESS models results in a confidence interval that is less prone to quick growth.\n\rWrapping It All Up\rNow that we’ve defined a model, we can finally answer the question in the title: do voters want Democrats or Republicans in congress? According to this model, voters are as even split as you can get!\nEven if there was a leader in the polls, the generic ballot’s predictive power this far out from the house elections is, to a first approximation, effectively useless. As we get closer to the election day, however, the polling model will become more and more useful. Additionally, the methods I used to generate the polling average can be replicated (with slight modifications) for other polling averages that will feed into the model, so stay tuned for more!\n\rSome Programming Notes\rI’ve skipped over quite a bit of programming detail. If you’re so inclined, you can read through the script to build the model and generate plots. There’s a lot going on there, but I’d like to highlight a few packages that were instrumental for putting this together:\n\rdoParallel: I frequently use doParallel, which uses multiple cores running in parallel to speed up processes. Most of the time, loading doParallel is just done for convenience’s sake, but it was absolutely necessary for this project — even with parallel processing, each round of model training was lengthy.\rfurrr: the goal of furrr is to combine purrr’s family of mapping functions with future’s parallel processing capabilities. Replacing my purrr::map() functions with furrr::future_map() functions literally cut training time in half.\rshadowtext: shadowtext is a small, niche package that allows you to add colored borders to geom_text() objects in a ggplot. It’s not visible in today’s chart because there’s 100% overlap between democrats \u0026amp; republicans, but there’s a white border around the text in front of the trendline that just looks nice.\r\r\r","date":1639440000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1639538462,"objectID":"279f09609bd2e6fb7a11853b1bce5c30","permalink":"https://www.thedatadiary.net/blog/2021-12-14-do-voters-want-democrats-or-republicans-in-congress/","publishdate":"2021-12-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/2021-12-14-do-voters-want-democrats-or-republicans-in-congress/","section":"blog","summary":"The 2022 midterms are still quite a ways away, however, in order to have a forecast ready in time, I need to start working on the model well in advance!","tags":[],"title":"Do Voters Want Democrats or Republicans in Congress?","type":"blog"},{"authors":[],"categories":["rstats"],"content":"\r\rHappy (belated) Thanksgiving! This year, my family drove down to Houston for the holiday \u0026amp; I hosted Thanksgiving for the first time. We played lots of games and ate well - my fridge is still stocked full of leftovers. Knowing we’d be busy with hosting, I planned ahead and scheduled a lighter post - this week, I thought I’d highlight some technical books that I’ve either referenced for modeling work, have been recommended to me, or I’ve heard about and would like to read:\n\rThe Elements of Statistical Learning is referenced as the Bible of Machine Learning by Josh Starmer and provides a robust and deeply technical foundation for a wide array of machine learning models. It’s considered a must-have among both machine learning theorists, who look for new model structures, and practitioners (like myself!).\rAn Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R is a companion to The Elements of Statistical Learning. An Introduction to Statistical Learning arose as a broader and less technical treatment of the key topics discussed in The Elements of Statistical Learning. Each section also includes learning-lab lessons walking through the implementation of the statistical learning method from that chapter (Emil Hvitfeldt is also working on a companion site for completing the labs with tidymodels).\rTidy Modeling with R is a guide to using the tidymodel framework and has been an excellent reference in both personal and professional projects.\rText Mining with R: a Tidy Approach serves as an introduction to text mining and other methods for dealing with unstructured, non-rectangular data. In my current role as a Consumer Experience Analyst, I have to interact with unstructured data (in the form of patient comments) daily - this book, along with the tidytext package, have been incredibly useful for analyzing and visualizing text data.\rSupervised Machine Learning for Text Analysis in R picks up where Text Mining with R left off by exploring (as the title suggests) supervised machine learning methods with text data. While I haven’t done extensive text modeling, this is one area that I’d like to explore further in 2022.\rFeature Engineering and Selection: A Practical Approach for Predictive Models is a guidebook offering methods for feature engineering (transforming and creating new predictor variables to improve predictive model performance). While I’ve utilized some basic feature engineering in some of my work, I’m interested in adding more robust tools to my feature-engineering toolkit!\rIntroduction to Empirical Bayes is David Robinson’s book coalescing a series of blog posts on Bayesian estimation, credible intervals, A/B testing, mixed models, and a host of other methods, all through the example of baseball batting averages.\rBuild a Career in Data Science is, as the name suggests, a book about building a career in data science. I generally feel that most career-help books are too broad to be useful or offer non-novel information for those in the industry the book is written for. Given, however, that I don’t have an academic or professional background in the field and that I’d like to eventually move from analytics to data science, I’d like to add this to the collection to pick up on some best practices.\r\r","date":1638057600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1638117661,"objectID":"dc2e08879b03a324595fb1207c846486","permalink":"https://www.thedatadiary.net/blog/2021-11-28-technical-books/","publishdate":"2021-11-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/2021-11-28-technical-books/","section":"blog","summary":"Happy (belated) Thanksgiving!

At the time of this writing, it seems overwhelmingly likely that Glenn Youngkin will become the next governor of Virginia. To avoid some of the galaxy-brain takes that will inevitabely wind up twitter, I thought I’d distract myself by following up on my previous post.\nFirstly, I should share the updated polling average.

This would suggest that McAuliffe’s loss is tied more closely to the national environment, rather than shifts amongst specific groups/counties.\nUpdate at nearly 1500 precincts: Youngkin is still on track for victory, running a ahead of what he needs across basically every dimension worth looking at.\nBut it\u0026#39;s worth noting just how close things are to \u0026#39;expectations,\u0026#39; which is simply shifting the 2020 result to the right pic.twitter.com/Mbe3pg7NFB\n\u0026mdash; Nate Cohn (@Nate_Cohn) November 3, 2021  And btw, if you\u0026#39;re doing pundit things I\u0026#39;d look at that red column.

Until there are deep dives into data regarding the election, I’d treat any comments rom pundits with a hefty grain of salt.\nSome closing thoughts\rThat’s all for me today!

To get the two-party voteshare, third party or other minor candidates are removed from each poll and each candidate’s percentage is recalculated as if they were the only two options on the ballot (in practice, this only removes a tiny amount of undecideds and third party voters). Then, the daily polling average is calculated by weighting each poll by sample size and recency. Using Bayes’ theorem and a weak uniform prior, we can use the same method recalculate the polling average and confidence interval for each day between today and the election. Because polls are weighted by recency, as we look further and further into the future, our confidence in the polls decreases and the confidence interval around the polling average fans out. Each candidate’s probability of winning is the portion of the portion of the projected election-day polling distribution in their favor, based on that day’s polling average.\n\rSome caveats worth noting\rThis is an inherently flawed method, and it’s worth pointing out a few of the flaws and shortcuts I used:\nThe functions used to weight polls are nowhere near perfect.\rThe original weighting functions (which I haven’t changed) were chosen somewhat arbitrarily. In hindsight, they’re probably placing too much emphasis on recency and the error bars ought to be larger. While I have received some advice on tuning arbitrary functions as a part of a larger model, I haven’t implemented here. It’s more prudent to think of this as an over-confident polling aggregate, rather than any sort of model. For a true projection model, I’d recommend looking at Jack Kersting’s website.\n\rThe weighting method ignores important weighting factors\rThis weighting method is super simple and ignores common weighting factors, like pollster and survey methodology. Other less-common poll weighting methods, like accounting for partisan non-response bias and and how the pollster weights their results (notably, whether or not the pollster weights by education) were similarly ignored. There is definitely a strong argument for including these weighting factors, but for me, this exercise was more about learning to use purrr::map() and other related functions when writing the script for this plot.\n\rSome pollsters are filtered out by design\rI debated this for quite some time, but decided to add a filter to remove polls conducted by Rasmussen and Trafalgar. Trafalgar is excluded from any of the Economist’s polling databases for opaque yet clearly shoddy methodology and Rasmussen is clearly partisan. Removing these from the average follows the general consensus on ET (though, to be transparent, ET does tend to slant far to the left). In future polling projects, I’d hope to develop some more robust methodology to programatically downweight problematic pollsters (how’s that for a tongue twister?), but for now I’m just going to exclude.\n\r\rFinal thoughts on polling\rThis methodology certainly has its flaws, but it is transparent. I’ll continuously update this plot up until election day on my github.\n\rSome programming notes\rI’ve finished migrating my site to Netlify! I had originally planned to make the switch from Squarespace sometime early in 2022, but motivation struck me during a relatively light work week and I was able to rebuild the site using blogdown. This allows for a lot more customization and control than was available with Squarespace, but the biggest upside is definitely the ease of sharing in-line code, here’s a quick example:\nlibrary(tidyverse)\r# let\u0026#39;s put together a plot from the diamonds dataset\rdiamonds %\u0026gt;%\rggplot(aes(x = carat,\ry = price,\rcolor = cut)) +\rgeom_point(alpha = 0.1) +\rtheme_minimal() +\rviridis::scale_color_viridis(discrete = TRUE)\rThis ease of use and visibility will make things more seamless for me and allow me to dig into more technical content in more detail in the future!\nI’ll be taking a (much needed) vacation next week, spending some time off the grid in the Grand Canyon and surrounding area with my family.

Here’s a few changes I’m planning on making, \u0026amp; also why I plan on making them.\nOpening up topic options\rUp until now, I’ve pretty much exclusively been looking at politically-related things from a data-centric point of view, partially because most news outlets are sensationalist and it annoys me, and partially because the 2020 election \u0026amp; aftermath was on my mind for most of early 2021 (also, wanting to understand the Economist’s Election Forecast methodology was the spark that led to taking stats classes, learning R, and [eventually] landing a new job). While I still want to/expect that I will touch on political-esque topics, I want to expand into things I’m more generally interested in. I’ve spent a lot of time this year working on projects that don’t touch politics and it was difficult to spur the enthusiasm to work on a political project just to fill the site after having spent hours coding something unrelated. I’ve imposed this political filter on myself, \u0026amp; expanding the horizon to include any/all topics that interest me will allow me to more consistently write without overextending myself.\n\rMoving away from Squarespace\rCurrently, this site is hosted by Squarespace. This was great for getting setup \u0026amp; used to working online, but after a year of working with it, I’ve realized that it isn’t the ideal platform for my use case. Early next year, hopefully, I’ll switch over to using rmarkdown, Hugo, and Netifly to build \u0026amp; deploy a site directly from R. This will make my life a lot easier, for a couple of reasons:\n\rI will have a lot more control over layouts and themes\rI’ll be able to more easily share code, images, and interactives(!)\rThe code \u0026amp; the website will be housed under one directory (rather than existing as two separate entities)\r\rAdditionally, the platform I’m planning on moving to is more blog/personal-professional focused, rather than retail focused, like Squarespace. I may also be able to move towards having posts appear in emails, rather than having to link to the post itself.\n\rTimeline\rI haven’t yet settled on this yet, but I may move from a weekly schedule to a bi-weekly schedule (not that I ever really stuck to the weekly schedule). The projects I’ve been working on typically take quite a bit of time, so trying to churn one out each week means that I may have to suffer quality for a schedule, which I don’t want to do. I’d rather have enough time to fully devote to completing something.\nAnyways, that’s a lot of updates - I’ll hopefully check in within a few weeks time!\n\r","date":1632355200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1632454528,"objectID":"86a3dca907acea562371f4cdc0ed1305","permalink":"https://www.thedatadiary.net/blog/2021-09-23-catching-up-again/","publishdate":"2021-09-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/2021-09-23-catching-up-again/","section":"blog","summary":"Wow, it’s been quite a while!

I’ve been working with \u0026amp; getting used to tidymodels, a suite of R packages for building machine learning models with tidyverse principles (you can thank Julia Silge’s blog for providing a whole host of examples and walkthroughs). Using tidymodels and Kaggle’s Titanic dataset, I created a few simple models to predict whether or not each passenger survived.\nExploratory Data Analysis\rFirst off, it’s important to get to know the dataset in a bit of detail before diving into model building. The Titanic dataset is relatively small, containing 12 columns of data on 891 passengers.\n\rPassengerId : ordered number assigned to each passenger (1, 2, 3… etc.).\rSurvived : indicates whether the passenger survived or not (imported as numeric, where a 1 means that the passenger survived and a 0 means that the passenger died.\rPClass : passenger class (1st, 2nd, or 3rd).\rName : passenger’s name.\rSex : passenger’s sex.\rAge : passenger’s age.\rSibSp : number of the passenger’s siblings and/or spouses aboard the ship.\rParch : number of the passenger’s parents and/or children aboard the ship.\rTicket : passenger’s ticket number.\rFare : price of the passenger’s ticket.\rCabin : passenger’s cabin number.\rEmbarked : port from which the passenger embarked.\r\rThe passenger’s name and ticket number are unique, and don’t offer any much predictive power (at least, not for the type we’ll be deploying), so I’ve removed those columns from the selection. The majority of passengers are missing Cabin information, so I’ve similarly removed that column. Let’s take a look at the age distribution by gender. Density plots are good for this sort of objective, but a quick note - density plots don’t show the counts (like a histogram), just the relative distribution of each group.\nBoth men and women have similar age distributions, with the majority being adults roughly in their twenties. It’d be interesting to look at which age groups survived.\nThere’s a spike survivorship at a young age (as expected, due to the prioritization of children). Young adults make up the majority of both survivors and those who died, simply because young adults made up the majority of passengers. It may be more interesting to see which male/female age groups survived.\nInterestingly, there’s a large portion of the women who died were children. To gain some more insight, however, it may be beneficial to bin the results. As mentioned above, density plots don’t show a count of each age, but the relative amounts instead. We can use a histogram to get a better idea of the actual amount in each group.\nFrom the histogram, we can see that there were far more male passengers than female passengers. Let’s setup age brackets and see how many of each age group survived.\nDespite there being more male passengers, there were more female survivors in just about every age bracket. I had expected that women would have a greater percentage of survivorship, but was mildly surprised that the absolute number of female survivors was greater than the number of male survivors.\nLets look at how survivorship is related to the number of family members each passenger was traveling with.\nWhile there’s not huge variation between survivorship percentages across each class, we can see that the majority of passengers were traveling alone.\nFinally, I looked at the distribution of the fare price by survivorship. As expected, passengers who didn’t survive skewed towards low cost fares while survivors were more evenly distributed across fare prices.\n\rModel Fitting and Evaluation\rNow that we’ve explored the data a bit, we can get started on some actual model fitting and evaluation. I split the dataset into a training set and test set, and built two simple models - a logistic regression and a random forest model. In very light detail, a logistic regression is the most basic classification model based on the generalized linear model and a random forest model is a decision tree-based algorithm. With no tuning applied, neither model performed particularly well - the logistic regression and random forest models had accuracies of 85.5% and 83.8% on the test set, respectively. While the logistic regression had a slightly higher accuracy on the test set, the random forest performed better on the metric of area under the ROC (receiver-operator characteristic) curve - 0.899 compared to 0.888 (generally, binary classification systems with ROC AUC values close to 1 perform better). A comparison between the two ROC curves is shown below.\nIt’s not perfect, but the purpose was to explore the tidymodels framework, and I’m pretty happy with the outcome/practice along the way.\n\rSome Things to Read/Watch/Listen to\r\rThere’s been a concerted effort by prominent conservatives to promote vaccination and shift the blame for vaccine hesitancy to the Biden administration, pointing in particular to one of Kamala Harris’ comments during the Vice Presidential debate. This criticism falls fairly short, given that commentators like Tucker Carlson and legislators like Marjorie Taylor Green continue to spread vaccine conspiracy theories. Further, a statistical model by the Economist found that the strongest predictor of whether or not someone has been vaccinated is who they voted for in the 2020 presidential election.\rJulia Silge was recently featured as a guest on an excellent episode of the Not So Standard Podcast.

Looking at retail gasoline prices, we can see a steady increase since Biden took office.\nWhat they fail to point out, however, is that the price of gasoline (and other commodities) significantly dropped during the pandemic, and that the increases are largely a return to pre-pandemic prices.\nWhile there are certainly opportunities to critique the current administration’s energy policy (banning new drilling leases on federal land/water and canceling the Keystone XL pipeline’s border-crossing permit, for example), attributing the recent return to pre-pandemic gasoline prices is a particularly weak and intentionally misleading avenue of attack.\nAs always, you can find my work on github.\nSome Reading/Viewing Material\r\rThe Economist wrote an interesting article finding a significant link between a county’s in-person voting rate and new COVID cases in November.\rElliot Morris summarized the work of several political scientists in a recent article describing why the GOP slid so far towards authoritarianism in the past decade.

Taken on its own, this is hardly surprising - Texas has gone to the Republican presidential candidate in every election since 1980. Looking at the relative gains made in Texas over recent election cycles, however, paints a much more hopeful picture for Democrats hoping to flip the state \u0026amp; garner the nickname, “blexas.”\nOn election day, FiveThirtyEight and the Economist gave Biden a 38% and 30% chance of winning in Texas, respectively. While still bearish on Biden, this is far more bullish than 2016, when FiveThirtyEight’s model gave Clinton a mere 5% chance of winning in Texas (in fact, both FiveThirtyEight and the Economist were more confident in Biden’s chance of winning Texas in 2020 than FiveThirtyEight was that Trump would win the presidency in 2016 (28%)). Part of this shift can be attributed to Democratic gains nationally, but Texas Democrats have been steadily gaining more ground than can be explained by national swing.\nThe Cook Political Report publishes its Partisan Voter Index (PVI) following each presidential election. PVI is a measure of how a state, district, or county votes relative to the national environment. For example, say a Democratic candidate wins 53% of the two-party voteshare nationally, but 51% in a given state. Despite the state going to the Democratic candidate, the state PVI would be R+2%, since the candidate performed 2% under the national vote (the actual PVI calculated in the Cook report is slightly more involved, but this basic understanding is sufficient for our purposes). Looking at Texas’ PVI over past elections, we see that Democrats have been making relative gains in every election since 2004, despite Texas still voting more Republican than the nation.\nMuch of this can likely be attributed to demographic shifts drive by major Texas cities - Dallas, Houston, Austin, and San Antonio have seen massive population increases, largely due to domestic and international migration (as opposed to natural changes - e.g., births). As Texas grows, it also continues to diversify. The non-hispanic white population in Texas dropped from 45% in 2010 to 41% in 2019, and non-white population groups have driven growth over the past 10 years.\nAll that being said, while I expect that Texas will continue to experience demographic shifts that are favorable in the eyes of Democratic politicians, in the absence of any real modeling work, I’m hesitant to say that Texas will turn blue in the near term. Despite gains in the presidential results, Texas Democrats didn’t outperform expectations in the house, nor did they even advance a candidate in the special election for TX-06 (two Republican candidates advanced to a runoff). Governor Abbott is also introducing a special legislative session with one goal (of many) of making Texas a state with some of the most restrictive voting laws with targeted partisan effects. Looking to other states as a reference, North Carolina had also seen similar PVI shifts in the past without resulting in Democratic victories (though, to be fair, North Carolina hasn’t experienced the same level of demographic shift that Texas is undergoing).\nPerhaps there is some modeling work I can do to produce a more definitive stance, but until then, I’ll hold on making any bold predictions.\nAs always, you can find my work on github.\nGeneral Updates\rIt’s been quite a while, but it’s good to get back into writing again.

I, did, however, sneak in some time to explore the 2020 Census Apportionment Results that were released yesterday. Some surprises came out of the release: Texas and Florida underperformed expectations, only gaining two and one seat, respectively; Arizona didn’t gain a seat; and New York lost a seat but was apparently 89 people short of retaining its seats. Given that Texas and Florida each gained one less seat than was generally expected, there’s been some speculation online that Donald Trump’s attempt to undercount Hispanics was successful, but backfired. I’ll hold my judgments on this theory until I can read some more in-depth opinions (if they get written).\nWith the new apportionment and population data, each individual’s representative power in congress has shifted. Including both Senators and House Representatives, states with smaller populations continue to have outsized representation in congress: Wyoming and Vermont have significantly more representatives per million residents than California or Texas, for example. Residents of Washington D.C., however, receive no representation in congress.\nAs a side note, the reps-per-million will be greater than the total number of congressional representatives in states with less than one million residents. This chart is really meant to compare the uneven representative power of each state.\nIf D.C. were to become a state, it would have outsized representative power, similar to Wyoming and Vermont, due to its size. That, however, isn’t really a justification to deny ~700,000 Americans national representation, and the arguments against D.C. statehood have been weak at best and implicitly racist at worst, given D.C.’s majority-minority population.\nStill, it’s virtually impossible that D.C. statehood receive the filibuster-proof 60 votes in the Senate (I’d doubt that even a compromise of retrocession into Maryland would pass). For the time being, residents of D.C. will have to wait for representation until polarized ideological walls come down and Republicans vote for D.C. statehood, Democrats gain enough seats for a supermajority, or the filibuster is abolished.\nAs always, you can find my work on Github.\n","date":1619481600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1619578221,"objectID":"c7ea4a98eb88d06855f5ddd80b63e10c","permalink":"https://www.thedatadiary.net/blog/2021-04-27-a-lukewarm-case-for-dc-statehood/","publishdate":"2021-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/2021-04-27-a-lukewarm-case-for-dc-statehood/","section":"blog","summary":"Once again, I’ll be keeping this very short, as I’ve continued to primarily focus on building out the demographic/economic database.

While the article is well intentioned, a simple linear model that predicts crossings based on month shows seasonality is a poor predictor (or, at least is a poor predictor on its own).\nExamining the Data\rThe US Border Patrol (USBP) publishes monthly data summarizing the number of encounters/crossings at the Southern border. Since November of 2020, border crossings have increased monthly, from about 70,000 in November to a little over 100,000 in February.\nLooking at the long term monthly data, however, reveals two key aspects:\n2019 was an exceptionally high year for crossings, and 2021 is on track to have a similar number of crossings;\rThere seems to be a cyclical set of peaks and troughs in annual border crossing numbers.\r\rLooking at the chart above, it’s difficult to determine which months correspond to peaks and troughs. Aligning by month offers a clearer picture of how monthly border crossings in each year compare to other years.\nFrom this chart, it does appear that there is some semblance of a monthly pattern, albeit with extreme outliers of 2019, 2020, and 2021. Appearances, however, can be deceiving, and a mathematical model can help distinguish signal from noise. Using month as a predictive input, we can create a model that estimates the expected number of crossings in said month. If we look at the residual error (the actual number of crossings minus the predicted number of crossings) over time, we can get an idea of how well the model is performing. If seasonality is a good predictor of the number of border crossings, the model will accurately account for seasonal shifts, and the residual error plot would be expected to remove or reduce the “waviness” that appears in the crossing plot and only show the long term trends.\nPlotting the residual error, however, doesn’t filter out seasonal noise. In fact, apart from the y-axis shifting down, the residual plot is strikingly similar to the crossings plot. This means that the month offers little power on its own in predicting the number of border crossings.\n\rClosing Remarks\rThe Washington Post article makes good points that aren’t discussed fully here, but are worth mentioning:\n\rThose who planned on crossing the border in 2020 but couldn’t due to travel restrictions may have simply waited until now to travel.\rUnaccompanied migrants are arriving at the border in rates that exclude the possibility of seasonal patterns.\r\rAlso notable is that seasonal patterns - while not a good predictor of the number of border crossings on its own - may be more impactful in a more robust model. As a professor from the University of San Diego explains, conditions in the migrant’s country of origin and the countries they pass through are among a host of variables that play a significant role in determining if migrants make the trip to the US border. While a more robust model may be able to accurately incorporate season into its predictions, simply using month as a predictor, as the Washington Post does in their article, does not explain the surge at the border (evidenced by the fact that this equally simple model refutes their finding).\nFinally, it should be noted that, above all else, there is a humanitarian crisis at the border. If you’d like to find a way to help or donate, Global Giving is an excellent resource.\n\rSome Other Updates\rHere’s what I’ve been working on recently:\n\rTidyTuesday: I’ve made my first contribution to #tidytuesday! For those who are unaware, TidyTuesday is a weekly data project in R for the R4DS (R for data science) community. Each week, a public dataset is released on Monday, allowing users to explore and create interesting visualizations and analyses based on the dataset. This week, a dataset based on global deforestation was released, but it came along with interesting information on the production of vegetable oil. I plotted the global annual vegetable oil production by crop type in the steamgraph below.\r\r\rCourses: I’ve continued with the machine learning and Bayesian courses, though I’ve descoped to roughly two days each week, as my personal schedule has gotten quite hectic. The ML course is excellent for understanding the theory that goes into each algorithm, but in practice, I expect that I will likely make use of the tidymodels R package’s relatively simple interface.\rRmd: I’ve started writing my code in a R markdown document, which allows me to mix both code and prose. I mix in some off-the-rails/stream of consciousness commentary as I step through the process to get to a functional code. For regularly updated/critical code/projects, I’ll still stick to concise scripts.\r\rThat’s all for this week - as always, you can read through the code for this piece or for the tidytuesday piece on github.

Here’s what I’ve been up to over the past week:\n\rTX COVID Tracker: Over the weekend, I put together and published my first Shiny application, a county-level interactive Texas COVID tracker.

This past week, I’ve scheduled an hour each day for dedicated class time, alternating daily between a Bayesian inference course and a machine learning course.\r\rMy plans for the upcoming week:\r\rTX COVID Tracker: While the interactive tracker is functional, it still leaves a lot to be desired. Being the first Shiny app I developed, I ran into a lot of learning curve issues but should be able to make updates more quickly. This upcoming week, I plan on converting to a bootstrap layout, adding in an interactive state map with leaflet, adding in statewide hospitalization and vaccination information, adding a state and county level log-log plot, making some formatting changes to help with mobile viewing, and updating themes/appearances. Eventually, I’d like to write a scheduleR script to automatically update the data, but that may need to be put off to focus on the laundry list above.\rClasses: I’ll still continue with the daily schedule for coursework and may be able to finish the Bayesian inference course this week.\r\rBetween the COVID tracker and classes, I don’t think I’ll have too much time to work on anything else. That being said, I’ve got some projects/articles in the backlog that I’m looking forward to working on:\n\rPolarization - top down or bottom up? It’s no secret that we are living in the most polarized political landscape since the Civil War, but I’m interested in exploring where this polarization originates. Do elected politicians split the public by pushing increasingly divisive policies? Or do voters lead the polarization effort by increasingly self-segregating into isolated camps?\rTwo Party PVI (Partisan Voter Index): The partisan voter index (PVI) is a measure of a state’s (or county’s) partisan preference relative to the national environment. There’s a story here about how the national environment is progressing - are our country voting preferences converging or diverging? What states are trending towards Democrats? What states are trending towards Republicans?\rThe Gas Price Fallacy: I’ve seen quite a few bad faith attempts to blame increasing gas prices on Joe Biden recently. Additionally, it’s particularly frustrating that I’ve seen a number of my colleagues in the oil \u0026amp; gas industry repeat this nonsense. As a working member of the oil \u0026amp; gas industry, I think I’m qualified and have a duty to explain why the administration change isn’t the cause of the rising gas prices (the TL;DR version is that we’re recovering from a global pandemic \u0026amp; oil oversupply, you can see that gas prices are just returning to pre-COVID Trump administration levelshere.)\r\r\r","date":1615766400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1615766400,"objectID":"d3d7e8381135f3e394e2db59849aa79a","permalink":"https://www.thedatadiary.net/blog/2021-03-15-recent-works/","publishdate":"2021-03-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/2021-03-15-recent-works/","section":"blog","summary":"One of the history teachers at my highschool was known for his prolific catchphrase, “give me the stuff, not the fluff,” often uttered to students attempting to submit history papers padded with superfluous words and sentences in order to meet a minimum word threshold.","tags":[],"title":"Recent Works","type":"blog"},{"authors":[],"categories":["archive"],"content":"\r\rThis week, I did something a bit different - the artwork above was made in R!

I wasn’t particularly tuned in to the Georgia senate elections prior to the runoff (by which time, the special election race had narrowed to just Warnock and Loeffler) and most of the coverage I had seen prior to Nov. 3rd pitted Warnock against Leoffler, without considering Collins. Even Google search trends show that people were more interested in Loeffler than Collins leading up to the election.\nDespite my ignorance, Collins was a major candidate in the special election, and ended up with a significant portion of the republican vote. It may be a bit obvious, but republicans splitting votes between Loeffler and Collins made Warnock a significantly more competitive candidate. However, the role of voter dropoff relative to the regular senate election is worth exploring in detail.\nComparing Results\rGeorgia’s regular senate election was a much more typical election than the special election - a tightly contested election between two candidates, Jon Ossoff (D) and David Perdue (R). The county result map comparing the voteshare of the two major candidates shows democratic strongholds in urban areas and a republican lean in rural areas. The county result map of the special election, if comparing Warnock to both Loeffler and Collins, is noticeably redder.\nIf we remove Collins, however, and just look at the county map comparing the top two candidates, the map shifts drastically in Warnock’s favor.\nAt face value, this explains how Warnock was able to advance to the runoff - split ticket votes aren’t usually good for the party with multiple major candidates. Voter dropoff between the regular and special election, however, shows just how much this pushed Warnock over the edge.\n\rVoter Retention: a Tale of Two Elections\rAbout 5 million Georgians voted in each of the senate elections in November. In the regular election, the major candidates, Ossoff and Perdue, accounted for about 98% of the votes, the rest going to Libertarian Shane Hazel or other write-in candidates. In the special election, on the other hand, a huge portion of Georgia voters didn’t vote for the major candidates - Warnock, Loeffler, and Collins only account for 79% of the votes! That’s about a 1 million voters who didn’t vote for their party’s major candidate (i.e., “dropped-off”).\nTo get a clear grasp of what voter retention means in this context, let’s consider a hypothetical county with 100 voters, of which 60 voted for Perdue and 40 voted for Ossoff in the regular election. Let’s also say these 100 voters split their special election votes in the following way: 35 votes for Loeffler, 15 votes for Collins, 30 votes for Warnock, and 20 write-in votes. In this scenario, Warnock retained 75% of regular election votes (30 / 40 = 75%), republicans, collectively, retained 83% ([35 + 15] / 60 = 83%), and Loeffler retained 58% (35 / 60 = 58%). In this hypothetical county, republicans collectively improved relative to the regular election, since they had a greater vote retention, but Loeffler on her own worsened, despite winning more votes than Warnock.\nIf we compare retentions for the entire state of Georgia, we can see that Loeffler and Collins were collectively better at retaining regular election votes than Warnock, retaining about 90% of Perdue votes compared to Warnock’s retention of about 68% of Ossoff votes. On her own, however, Loeffler was worse at retaining votes than Warnock, retaining a little over 50% of Perdue votes. This means that Warnock improved democratic performance relative to the regular election when compared against Loeffler directly.\nRepeating this comparison across every county in Georgia shows that Loeffler and Collins, collectively, improved republican performance relative to the regular senate election across every single county. When, however, Collins is omitted, and Warnock and Loeffler are compared directly, democratic performance improves across the majority of counties.\n\rIn Summary\rWhile it was obvious from the beginning that the split ticket hurt republicans in Georgia’s special senate election, it’s interesting to see just how much this split ticket helped Warnock. Collectively, republicans handily won the special election, but splitting votes between Loeffler and Collins meant that Warnock ended up winning a plurality of the votes.\nPolitical analysists are probably better than me at examining why multiple republicans ran as major contenders for the special senate election, but a quick take is that Kelly Loeffler wasn’t a particularly strong candidate. Although she was an incumbent, she wasn’t a senator any Georgian had ever voted for - she gained her senate seat through appointment. Loeffler came to office as a moderate, but quickly pivoted to a more Trumpy ideology, eventually defining herself as “more conservative than Atilla the Hun” in a campaign ad (I would normally just add a hyperlink, but this ad is just too weird not to link directly - I originally thought this was a bad parody).\n   Her campaign was also plagued by a few scandals, like darkening Warnock’s skin in a campaign ad, taking photos with known KKK members, and potentially making stock trades based on COVID-19 information not-yet released to the public. It’s a bit of a conjecture, so take this with a grain of salt, but all of the above factors may have provided Collins an opportunity to run as a stronger \u0026amp; less divisive alternative to Loeffler.\n\rSome Final Notes\rChoropleth charts (maps) can be misleading in the wrong context - it’s easy to subconsciously associate area with population. It wasn’t particularly relevant to the post above, but in spirit of the animation “Land doesn’t vote, people do”, I added dot-plot maps where bubble size corresponds to total number of votes.\nAs always, source data and code can be found on github. I’m particularly happy with how this post turned out. I learned a lot of new things worth highlighting (some of this gets into technical mumbo jumbo):\n\rLearned how to use the maps, gganimate, and gifski packages;\rPicked up new method of piping objects into a ggplot object;\rWorked with geom_col and geom_poly for the first time;\rUsed forcats for the first time (just to reorder a factor, but I’ll still count it as a win);\rAdded new colors to the dd color palette;\rCreated a reusable theme var to reduce code;\rStarted using tibbles.\r\rFor this post, I had originally wanted to compare presidential vote to senate, governor, and house vote, but I had to pivot a bit to just the Georgia senate elections, for a few reasons. Firstly, the senate county dataset from Kaggle, for whatever reason, doesn’t include the winner of each county. Adding this by hand, just for Georgia’s 159 counties and two senate elections took hours. There’s probably a more efficient way to do this by scraping the data from online, but then I’d have to have learned a scraping package in addition to all of the other packages. I may have to hold on the original post idea for a bit while I pick up these skills.\nThat being said, I’ve already started working on next week’s post. It’s a bit of a departure from what I’ve been doing, so I’m excited to see how it’ll turn out.\n\r","date":1614470400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1614564255,"objectID":"dc5efebc4072f04d4aaeb650fb4243de","permalink":"https://www.thedatadiary.net/blog/2021-02-28-doug-collins-saved-raphael-warnock-s-senate-bid/","publishdate":"2021-02-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/2021-02-28-doug-collins-saved-raphael-warnock-s-senate-bid/","section":"blog","summary":"I’ll be honest - prior to writing this post, I had never heard of Doug Collins (R), the third major candidate in the race for Georgia’s special senate election after Raphael Warnock (D) and Kelly Loeffler (R).","tags":[],"title":"Doug Collins Saved Raphael Warnock's Senate Bid","type":"blog"},{"authors":[],"categories":["archive"],"content":"\r\rI’m about 4 months too late, but to practice forecasting, I made a modest projection for the 2020 national popular vote using polling data from the two weeks leading up to election day. In the weeks leading up to the election, aggregated polling was fairly stable, and the model projection was within 1.5% of the actual outcome (both the model and actual outcome are adjusted to exclude third parties and instead show the two-party vote share).\nThe projected outcome of Biden’s vote share, 53.6%, is only the most likely outcome in a distribution of possible outcomes predicted by the model. Of the possible outcomes, Biden wins the popular vote about 70% of the time, according to the November 2nd projection.\nLike the projected vote share, the probability of Biden winning the popular vote remained fairly constant in the two weeks leading up to the election.\nIf you were like me, obsessing over the prominent forecast models prior to election day, you may notice that this projection is substantially less confident in the outcome than the leading forecasters. FiveThirtyEight and the Economist, for example, both projected similar popular vote outcomes (within a percentage point of this forecast), but gave Biden at least a 97% of winning the popular vote! There are a couple reasons for this difference:\n\rThis model is one-dimensional : this is a pretty simple model built just to get practice with forecasting and some of the tools in R, so it only uses polls (and, at that, only a small subset of polls), whereas other forecast models used a wide variety of variables to inform the model (economic indicators, demographics, partisanship, etc.).\rThis model doesn’t weight polls : aside from the sample size of the poll, this model doesn’t apply any weights or corrections to the polling data. The polling method, date the poll was taken, and pollster house effect (i.e., how partisan the pollster tends to be relative to the average) can be used to inflate or deflate the weight of each poll in the model. This simple model ignores all of that and treats every poll as equal.\rThis model forces an uncertainty range : unlike other models, which are a set of linear regressions, this model is a relatively simple beta distribution of the vote, with the sum of parameters manually set to 50. This is a bit of technical mumbo-jumbo, but the gist is that a beta distribution allows you to control its “peaky-ness,” and I did this manually, whereas other forecasters had the model do it for them. Increasing the sum of parameters increases how peaky the distribution looks, and a sum of 50 was used based on Florian Muellerklein’s Georgia runoff model, which also used a sum of 50.\r\rSome Notes\rAs always, you can find source data and code on github. I’m pretty happy with how this turned out - I’ve been getting a bit more comfortable with R, and the tools used for this post were pretty intuitive to implement. I’m also happy with the color palette I selected (HTML Color Picker is a godsend). The only improvement is that I could/should have saved quite a bit of code by writing over one of the plot themes, rather than re-writing the theme for each plot. Something to remember going forward.\nNext week, I’ll dig into some of the county-level data from the election to see if there was any ticket splitting between the presidential election and the down-ballot races.\n\r","date":1613865600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1613958877,"objectID":"d7c4612a321f149a7aec1f159cfc8d5c","permalink":"https://www.thedatadiary.net/blog/2021-02-21-kind-of-projecting-the-2020-election/","publishdate":"2021-02-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/2021-02-21-kind-of-projecting-the-2020-election/","section":"blog","summary":"I’m about 4 months too late, but to practice forecasting, I made a modest projection for the 2020 national popular vote using polling data from the two weeks leading up to election day.","tags":[],"title":"(Kind of) Projecting the 2020 Election","type":"blog"},{"authors":[],"categories":["archive"],"content":"\r\rA baseball forecast that correctly predicts the winner of the 15 opening day games could be a truly accurate model, or could just be getting lucky. Over the course of 6 months and 2,430 regular season games, however, a great forecast will continue to shine whereas an initially lucky one will falter. In data rich environments like sports, there are lots of events (games) over the course of a season to judge how well a model is performing.\nWhen there aren’t a lot of events to forecast, like presidential elections that occur once every four years (quadrennially?), it’s more difficult to tell how well a forecast performs (a handful of correct/incorrect predictions could just be good/bad luck!), but forecasters still have tools available to evaluate their model. This week, I took a look at a few different methods of comparing different models.\nScoring the Forecasters\rThe most common scoring method, the Brier score, is a measurement of a probabilistic forecast’s accuracy based on the confidence of the prediction. Each event has its own score, and the average of all predicted events is the model’s Brier score. Highly confident predictions are highly rewarded/punished for their accuracy/inaccuracy, whereas timid predictions don’t move the needle too much, regardless of the outcome. Scores can range from 0.00 to 1.00, with 0.00 being a perfect score (you can read more about Brier scores here, but the gist is that the lower the score, the better). In presidential forecasts, each state can be considered an event.\nOftentimes, presidential forecasters report Brier scores as weighted by each state’s number of electors. Correctly predicting Texas’ winner in this scoring system is far more important than correctly predicting Wyoming’s winner, given that Texas’ 38 electoral votes far overshadow Wyoming’s 3. I’m not quite convinced that this is the most meaningful way to evaluate models (California is pretty easy to predict and heavily weighted by its 55 electoral votes, but most of us were more concerned with Georgia’s outcome, despite being undervalued by this scoring method), but forecasters do use this scoring method.\nFinally, I came up with my own scoring method that makes a “bet” between $0 and $100 based on prediction confidence. 100% confidence would turn into a $100 bet, and 50% confidence (aka, a coin toss) would be a $0 bet. Each model’s average winnings (including losses) is reported as the score.\nI scored a few prominent presidential forecasts based on the above methodologies (you can read more about the JHK, Economist, FiveThirtyEight, and Bitecofer forecasts at the links here). While all the scoring methods are similar - rewarding confidence in correct predictions and penalizing meek or incorrect predictions - each model’s performance is all over the map (with perhaps the exception of Bitecofer, which scores in the lower half of all methods). But does that mean these methods are useless? No! If anything, it highlights the importance that each forecast method’s performance should be scored across a wide variety of scoring methodologies. While it might not make a huge difference at the margins, it may separate some models as clearly ahead or behind the curve.\nSo, how does each forecast model measure up? It depends on which yardstick you use!\nHere are some other things to consider with regards to each model:\n\rUnlike the Economist, FiveThirtyEight, and Bitecofer models, which simulate each state’s outcome thousands of times and reports the confidence as the percentage of simulations won, the JHK forecast reports the percentage of winning results that fall within the 80% confidence interval around the expected vote. Lower confidence intervals result in tighter bands, so this relatively low confidence interval means that the model is allowed to make quite a few 100% confident predictions (which, luckily for the model, all came true in this case).\rThe Bitecofer forecast is the only model that doesn’t utilize polls and instead uses an in-house developed negative-partisanship model.\rBased on conversations between Nate Silver of FiveThirtyEight and Elliott Morris of the Economist, it appears that FiveThirtyEight added a bit of uncertainty ad-hoc to account for COVID, whereas the Economist did not.\r\rAs always, source files and code can be found on github. Next week, I plan on making a relatively modest prediction of the election’s popular vote outcome based on polls from the final week.\n\r","date":1613260800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1613353654,"objectID":"05bdc3783344d04ef854139107cbb69b","permalink":"https://www.thedatadiary.net/blog/2021-02-14-scorecasting/","publishdate":"2021-02-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/2021-02-14-scorecasting/","section":"blog","summary":"A baseball forecast that correctly predicts the winner of the 15 opening day games could be a truly accurate model, or could just be getting lucky.

Instead, I’ve listed out below a number of creators that I follow on various platforms. If you’re interested in data or critical thinking, each is well worth your time and attention.\nNewsletters\r\rFiveThirtyEight : While it’s not technically a newsletter, the FiveThirtyEight site, created by statistician Nate Silver prior to the 2008 presidential election, is the original source for data-driven news (or, at least, one of the first sites to popularize data as a news resource). Nate created the site specifically because the narrative created by pundits, that the 2008 election was super close, was pretty easily refutable when you looked at the polling data, which showed that Obama was going to win handily. Now, FiveThirtyEight is a powerhouse of data analysis for politics, sports, and science, and often serves as a good reality check against the narratives espoused by talking heads on the major news networks.\n\rG. Elliott Morris’ Newsletter : G. Elliott Morris is a data journalist for the Economist and created their forecast for the 2020 presidential election. In addition to regularly writing for the Economist, Elliott also writes a weekly newsletter in which he comments on polls that caught his eye (he also has a subscriber newsletter, for those who want to get his thoughts on even more topics). Elliott is also writing a book on the history of public polls, their limitations, and their future in American politics, which I am looking forward to reading when it releases later this year.\rAs an aside, Elliott and I are the same age, and he was a large part of the inspiration for me to start diving into statistics again (i.e., if he can do it, so can I). Elliot is pretty bearish on the future of American democracy, especially following Donald Trump’s repeated attempts to overturn the overwhelmingly clear and overwhelmingly fair results of the election and the attempted (but, thankfully, woefully unorganized) coup by insurrectionists on Jan. 6th. Despite all this, I’m a bit more hopeful for the future of democracy, and hope to be able to provide a more positive opinion alongside Elliott’s (provided it’s supported by the data!).\rInfinite Monkeys : Started by a collection of college students who met via #ElectionTwitter, the Infinite Monkeys newsletter (named such from the theory that, an infinite collection of monkeys hitting keys on typewriters will eventually write the entirety of Shakespeare’s work by random chance) take a look at geographical trends and their relation to current political headlines. It’s a relatively recent startup, and I’m looking forward to the development of the newsletter \u0026amp; its coalition of authors over the coming years.\rVisual in the Noise : The Visual in the Noise is a weekly newsletter focused on data visualization. Most often looking at sports (particularly, NBA) data, the Visual in the Noise is a great touch-point for the importance of visualization and how it can help make data more insightful.\r\r\rPodcasts\r\rThe Daily : The Daily is, appropriately, a daily (Mon. - Fri.) podcast hosted by the New York Times, covering important topics in the American landscape. The podcast generally focuses in on individuals, and how national stories can affect people personally (for example, touching base with a bar throughout the pandemic as they wade through the difficulties of diminished business, PPP applications, and unclear direction from the government). On Sundays, a guest reads an older, long form New York Times piece.\rThe Intelligence : The Intelligence, similarly to the Daily, is a daily weekday podcast covering important topics in the news, though typically has a more global focus than the Daily. Rather than following individuals, the Intelligence often brings in subject matter experts and local correspondents.\rChecks and Balance : This weekly podcast by the Economist takes a deep dive into one big topic shaping American politics each week. Approximately 45 minutes per podcast, the Checks and Balance hosts take care to thoroughly explore each topic.\rFiveThirtyEight’s Politics Podcast : Every week, the FiveThirtyEight team covers the latest news in politics, utilizing polling data to guide their discussion. During election years, they also host intermittent “Model Talks,” where Nate Silver talks about into some of the intricacies of the site’s forecast models based on questions from listeners.\n\rThe Rational Reminder : A non-politics podcast, the Rational Reminder is a weekly podcast discussing index investing and rational decision making. Although the podcast is made by and for Canadians, most of the content is widely applicable, and the podcast has garnered an international audience.\r\r\rYouTube\r\r3blue1brown : Many concepts in math can feel daunting and teaching methods are often unintuitive. Grant Sanderson’s channel attempts to introduce viewers to the beauty of math through intuitive visualizations and animations. As a fun fact, the animations are run via a python package, manim, developed on-the-fly by Grant himself!\rPhilip DeFranco : One of the original members of the YouTube community, Phil has grown from a weekly commentary on popular videos via a webcam in his bedroom to a daily rundown of the news backed by a full production staff. Phil does an excellent job of presenting the news whilst making it clear where the official reporting stops and his opinion starts.\rLegal Eagle : Dubbed “YouTube’s Lawyer,” Devin (DJ) Stone provides a perspective on the role the law plays in current events and controversies (as well as more fun videos, like reviewing a Spongebob episode for legal accuracy). I’m not sure how he manages to balance the two full time jobs of running channel with near-daily longform content and being a lawyer with active litigation, but I appreciate that he is able to find time for thoughtful (and often comedic) insight.\n\rCommon Sense Investing : Ben Felix’s Common Sense Investing investigates the academic research supporting passive, rather than active, portfolio management (in summary: the data shows that passive index investing is overwhelmingly a more effective long term investment strategy than trusting an active portfolio manager with your money).\rStandup Maths : Mathematician, comedian, and Excel-enthusiast Matt Parker shares the joy that can be found in math by exploring topics in a comedic setting. Matt’s book, Humble Pi, explores some of history’s most famous mathematical blunders, and is coming up soon on my reading list.\rNumberphile : The Numberphile channel is a collection of interviews of prominent mathematicians explaining interesting historical math problems on trademark brown parchment paper. Grant Sanderson and Matt Parker make appearances on the channel a number of times (the infamous Parker square first made its appearance on Numberphile).\rMinutePhysics : As Henry Reich, the channel owner, puts it, the channel is simply about “cool physics and other sweet science.” Henry’s videos explain concepts in physics via a whiteboard, expo markers, and a backdrop of jazzy standup bass.\r\r\rElection Twitter\rThere are quite a few, so I’ll just highlight a few \u0026amp; link ot the rest\n\rLakshya Jain : Lakshya is a software engineer and self-described amateur elections mapper/analyst. He’s a very vocal (and self-labeled) partisan democrat, so I take his non-analytical posts with a grain of salt, but his analytical posts are very insightful.\rJack Kersting : A relative rarity on Election Twitter, Jack is a conservative forecaster. He’s not an ardent twitter user, but developed one of the most complete and thorough election forecasts I’ve seen outside of professional work.\rMax : A self described mapmaker, shitposter, and ardent supporter of Long Nebraska, Max is known for his oddball posts and lukewarm political takes.\rSome other folks I follow for election maps/data: Nate Silver, G.

In the weeks leading up to the introduction, there’s been an influx on twitter of bad faith attacks, outright factually incorrect statements, and the type of fact-free arguments that pundits love (to be fair, my twitter timeline is biased towards my left-leaning friends, so the majority of what I see are poorly formulated left-leaning takes, but it’s pretty easy to find similarly bad right-leaning takes). The slew of emotion-driven arguments muddies the water around the minimum wage discussion by avoiding references to data. In an effort to find the signal in all this noise, I dug into publicly available databases to hopefully provide at least one opinion grounded in empiricism, rather than emotion.\nMy Priors\rFor transparency’s sake, prior to taking a look into the data behind the minimum wage debate, I was of the belief that the minimum wage should increase and that the proposed $15 per hour seemed reasonable. I didn’t have an empirically driven reason for this belief, just a vague sense that the minimum wage hadn’t risen in a while and had therefore effectively been deflating. Anecdotally, I also hadn’t seen a good defense of keeping the minimum wage static (in fact, most of the arguments against raising the minimum wage that I’d seen were laughably bad). My prior was built on little data, so the analysis I set out to do would either strongly confirm or refute it.\n\rThe History of the Minimum Wage\rIn 1947, the federal government introduced a minimum wage for hourly-compensated labor as part of an amendment to the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). First set at $0.40 per hour, the minimum wage has risen periodically throughout its 80 year history - most recently rising to $7.25 per hour in 2009. Currently, 29 states and D.C. have state minimum wages greater than the minimum wage, and several state minimum wages are increasing in 2021 (either due to ballot initiatives or automatic increases based on cost of living).\nI’ve seen a theory float around that, had the minimum wage risen with inflation, it would be $22 per hour today, rather than $7.25 per hour. This is pretty overtly false.* Using the consumer price index (CPI) as the standard measure of inflation, the nominal minimum wage throughout the years can be adjusted to real (aka, inflation-adjusted) dollars:\nIn inflation-adjusted terms, the minimum wage peaked around 1968 at $12.20 per hour ($1.60 per hour, unadjusted). The current minimum wage of $7.25 per hour, while on the lower end of inflation-adjusted historical values, is not the lowest it’s ever been, and a $15 per hour minimum wage would set a new record for both adjusted and unadjusted minimum wage. Critics of the proposed increase may point to this as reason to keep the minimum wage at its current value - why increase the minimum wage beyond its historical high if it hasn’t even reached its historical low? Supporters, on the other hand, may argue that the minimum wage has never been enough.\n\rThe Minimum Wage’s Dance Between Two Thresholds\rIn 1978, the Census Bureau and Department of Health and Human Services set a baseline administrative threshold to determine eligibility for financial assistance from the federal government. Dubbed the “poverty threshold,” this value was created based on an approximation of the annual budget various family units require to meet basic food \u0026amp; shelter needs (for example, a single adult with no children would need to earn less per hour to meet his needs than, say, a nuclear family of two working adults and two children). The Census Bureau updates the threshold annually by simply adjusting for inflation.\nMany groups, however, argue that the poverty threshold doesn’t meet basic needs and instead advocate for a living wage. The living wage is similar in concept to the poverty threshold, but generally much higher, as it includes an expanded food budget (the poverty threshold is based on USDA’s “thrifty” food plan), a budget cap on rent (generally set at ~30% of a monthly budget), healthcare, and childcare, amongst other additions.\nBased on MIT Lab’s Living Wage Calculator, we can see that, for a family of four with two working adults, the minimum wage has historically been marginally greater than the poverty threshold, but never reaches (or approaches) the living wage:\nFigure 2, above, shows the national minimum and living wages, but these values vary by location. Figure 3 below shows the minimum and living wages for each state. Even states with minimum wages greater than the federal minimum do not meet the local living wage:\n\rThe Proposed Increase\rSo how does the proposed increase to the minimum wage fare against the living wage and poverty threshold in the future? If inflation continues to hold at about 1.6%, the increased minimum wage will get significantly closer to, but not greater than, the living wage in 2025.\nIs this enough? Arguably, no, as the proposed increase is less than the estimated living wage. But it is certainly a step in the right direction, and if passed, would likely keep the minimum wage above the poverty threshold for quite some (the poverty threshold rises roughly at a rate of $1 per hour every 10 years).\n\rMy Posterior\rIn general, my prior was confirmed by the analysis - my belief that the minimum wage should be increased has strengthened, and there’s a believable argument that the $15 per hour increase could be raised even higher. There are some additional points that I didn’t discuss above, however, that are still worth noting:\n\rThere are many different groups that have estimated living wages, and results can vary (I used MIT Lab’s data because it was the most readily available \u0026amp; also provided state, county, and metropolitan level data). In general, however, living wage estimates agree that the poverty threshold is far too low, and typically show living wages in excess of $15 per hour.\rThe percentage of hourly workers earning the federal minimum wage (or less) has decreased over the years and currently rests at about 1.9%. This is in part due to many states having minimum wages greater than the federal minimum. If the minimum wage increases to $15 per hour, the total number of workers earning the federal minimum wage will likely increase (the linked chart shows spikes that correspond to minimum wage increases in the ‘90s and 2009).\rSome critics of the increased minimum wage argue that the minimum wage is only meant for teenagers working summer jobs. The data doesn’t support this argument - over 80% of federal minimum wage workers are 20+ years old.\rIn 2019, the Congressional Budget Office released a report that estimated that job losses due to an increased minimum wage could range between 4.7 million and 0, with a median of 1.3 million lost jobs. The report also notes, however, that about 17 million workers would benefit from the wage increase.\r\rThe linked NYT opinion article does give itself the caveat that the $22 per hour figure is based on “inflation and productivity,” though others have repeated this $20+ per hour wage argument without this caveat. The opinion article doesn’t mention any sources or databases, though I expect that the author is using GDP as a proxy for inflation - several articles point out that if the minimum wage had kept pace with GDP growth since 1968, it’d be significantly greater than even the proposed $15 per hour minimum wage. Correlating this to inflation, however, is at best a significant oversight by the author/editor, and at worst intentionally deceptive.\n\rSome Other Notes\rAs always, source data for this post can be found on github. I made an overt attempt to keep the code a bit cleaner this time around (having a “test area” in the code helped out). It’s still not perfect, and I suspect I’ll just naturally get better at writing neatly formatted scripts as the language becomes more intuitive.\nI think I’m going to take a break for a couple weeks from some of these longer posts - I’m currently finishing this a bit after midnight (which is very late for me!) - and between writing this \u0026amp; the Bayes’ Theorem post, I’ve had little time to dedicate to stats. Next week, I’ll put together a less intensive piece to give myself time to push forward with the stats class. Maybe after that I can write a quick post about the accuracy of prediction models, then get into another deep dive. We’ll see how I feel about it in the next couple weeks.\n\r","date":1612051200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1612142350,"objectID":"d15ab6af99788899a9f47dec45d4f210","permalink":"https://www.thedatadiary.net/blog/2021-01-31-the-min-wage-debate/","publishdate":"2021-01-31T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/2021-01-31-the-min-wage-debate/","section":"blog","summary":"On January 26, House Democrats introduced a bill to raise the federal minimum wage from $7.25 per hour to $15 per hour by 2025.

Consider a perfectly ideal coin flip. I know that, for any given coin flip, the probabilities of landing either heads-up or tails-up are exactly the same: 50%. Moreover, this is true no matter how many times I flip the coin. If the coin lands heads-up on the first flip, I still have a 50% chance of the coin landing heads-up on the next flip (and the next flip, and the next flip, etc.).\nBut what if I’m told the coin has a manufacturing defect, and is slightly heavier on one side (lets say, to favor tails-up)? I might assume, starting out, that the defect is small, and has a negligible effect on my odds of the coin landing heads-up. But every flip that lands tails-up changes my certainty about the true odds. That’s the heart of Bayes’ Theorem, and the biggest difference between bayesian statistics and frequentist statistics. With frequentist statistics, when the data updates, the uncertainty stays the same, whereas with bayesian statistics, when the data updates, the uncertainty updates as well.\nSo why is this important? Well, at a base level, just about every forecasting model needs to make use of Bayes’ Theorem. So with the long term goal of building a predictive election model, it’s pretty dang important to have a firm understanding of the foundation the model will rest on. But in a more general sense, I think it’s important to understand how views can (and should) update in the light of new data. From what I can tell, the majority of opinions (especially political opinions…) are either based on assumptions or cherry-picked data points, and typically don’t update - even when presented with new evidence. In contrast, to think like a bayesian is to weigh the severity of new information against the history of data and update your views accordingly.\n\rUgly vs. Pretty Bayes\rEquation 1 above shows Bayes’ Theory. As expressed in statistical language, it reads, “the probability of A, given event B, is equal to the probability of B, given event A, and the probability of A divided by the probability of B.” As written, Bayes’ Theorem is… unintuitive… Even reading the description back to myself stirs up memories of fumbling through my high school stats class. The way the equation is written doesn’t lend itself towards being accessible, but, as Grant Sanderson points out in this video, reframing the equation into a geometry problem makes Bayes’ Theorem much easier to understand (much of the rest of this post is applying Bayes’ Theorem via Grant’s geometrical framing).\nTo understand how a geometrical framing can help make sense of Bayes’ Theorem, it’s best to run through an example. So let’s get back to the doctor’s office \u0026amp; cancer screening.\nLet’s first consider a population group of 10,000, arranged on a grid of 100 x 100. If we know that 1% of the population has cancer, we can divide the group into two segments, cancer-free and cancerous, as shown below:\nIf we avoid any compounding risk factors (like age, sex, diet, etc.) \u0026amp; assume that the likelihood of having cancer is the same for everyone, any person in the population can say that they are 99% certain that they do not have cancer. But how might this certainty update for someone who gets a positive result from a cancer screening test?\nThe reliability of cancer screening tests are measured by their sensitivity \u0026amp; specificity. A test’s sensitivity is the the proportion of cancer-positive patients it correctly identifies (i.e., “true positives”). For example, if a screening test has a sensitivity of 90% and is used to test 100 cancerous patients, we’d expect 90 of these patients to receive a correct positive result and the remaining 10 patients to receive an incorrect negative result. The specificity, on the other hand, is the proportion of cancer-free patients the test correctly identifies. If the screening test’s specificity is 92% and is used to test 100 cancer-free patients, we’d expect 92 patients to correctly receive a negative result and 8 patients to incorrectly receive a positive result (a “false positive”). I tend to find it easier just to think about the positive cases, so from now on, I’ll refer to a test’s true positive rate and false positive rate, rather than the sensitivity \u0026amp; specificity.\nLet’s assume that a cancer screening test has the true positive \u0026amp; false positive rates above, 90% \u0026amp; 8%, respectively. How certain should someone who tests positive be that they truly have cancer? A test that gives a true positive 90% of the time seems pretty damning, but the 8% false positive rate isn’t insignificant. An important step is to realize that this person is no longer looking for the probability of having cancer, but instead looking for the probability of having cancer given that they have a positive test result.\nFor someone who receives a positive test result, it may be helpful to think about the hypothetical question: “What if everyone took this test?” This reframing can help us think in terms of people, rather than probabilities.\nGiven that 1% of the 10,000 person population has cancer, we can divide the group into two segments: 100 people with cancer, and 9,900 people without cancer.\nIf everyone takes the screening test, we’d expect 90 true positives (90% x 100 = 90) and a whopping 792 false positives (8% x 9,900 = 792)!\nAlthough the test is fairly accurate in terms of sensitivity \u0026amp; specificity (90% and 92% are both considered A’s, by most grading standards) the sheer number of non-cancerous people in the population results in a large number of false positives. Of all the 882 positive cases (792 + 90 = 882), only 90 are true positives, meaning that the probability of having cancer given a positive test result is about 10% (90 / 882 = 10.2%). While this is a significant increase from the prior assumption, 1%, it’s still far likelier that someone with one positive test result doesn’t have cancer. This is why it’s important to get a second opinion. It’s not that your first doctor is an idiot, just that your uncertainty has changed!\nNow what would happen if all the people who received a positive result took another test? Well, of this subset of 882 patients, we expect that 792 are cancer free and 90 are cancerous:\nWhen these 882 patients take the second test, we still expect the test to hold the same true positive \u0026amp; false positive rates - meaning we can expect 81 true positives (90% x 90 = 81) and about 63 false positives (8% x 792 = 63). This means that, of the 144 positive cases (81 + 63 = 144), 81 are true positives, and the probability of having cancer given two positive results is about 56% (81 / 144 = 56%).\nWith this new round of data from test results, those who receive a second positive result once again update their prior assumption from 10% to 56%. In fact, every test result, positive or negative, should either support or refute the prior. Each positive test result, appropriately, increases your likelihood of actually having cancer. Similarly, each negative result decreases your likelihood.\nThat’s the beauty of Bayes’ Theorem in a nutshell. Gathering new information allows you to update your prior belief!\n\rIn Summary…\rI may have gotten too in the weeds with this post, though, to be fair, walking through Bayes’ Theorem in detail also helps my understanding. I likely wont dive as deep into stats topics in the future. In part, they’re a bit of a slog to read through if you’re not as excited as I am by this kind of stuff. But it also took me a good chunk of time to write this post. Going forward, I’d like to better balance my time between the three goals of coding, writing, and learning stats.\nAs always, I’ve posted my work to github, though this file just includes an excel workbook \u0026amp; a few pictures. Next week, I’ll dig more into plotting with ggplot - likely with a much shorter post!\n\r","date":1611446400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1611536691,"objectID":"9fbe18bdedc46397a2c4f3fc14bde0ba","permalink":"https://www.thedatadiary.net/blog/2021-01-24-your-doctor-probably-isn-t-an-idiot/","publishdate":"2021-01-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/2021-01-24-your-doctor-probably-isn-t-an-idiot/","section":"blog","summary":"There’s a great standup routine about doctors (which I spent about an hour trying to find online with no luck!) with a punchline to the effect of, “getting a positive cancer test then requesting a second opinion is basically the medical equivalent of telling your doctor you think they’re an idiot to their face.","tags":[],"title":"Your Doctor Probably Isn't an Idiot","type":"blog"},{"authors":[],"categories":["archive"],"content":"\r\rEditor’s note: I’ve gone back \u0026amp; read my previous post, \u0026amp; have one general thought - yeeeesh… Everything is so… “matter of fact” in tone \u0026amp; doesn’t really sound like me.

That being said, I’m going to try to make a more conscious effort going forward of having my voice be expressed in my writing. This is my blog, after all, so it should sound like my voice when read back.\nPlotting in R\rI’ve started getting more familiar with R \u0026amp; wrangling my way through a few plotting examples (Youtube university is, once again, my best friend), but I thought it would be worthwhile to work towards plotting my own dataset. Luckily enough, plotting with R is pretty intuitive, once you get ahold of the basic syntax. I had put together a dataset on past US presidential elections for a separate personal project, and was able to convert to a .csv to use for some basic plotting practice.\nIt’s generally well understood that the Republican party has a structural advantage in presidential elections due to the winner-take-all nature of the electoral college, but I wanted to see if I could quantify this advantage in an understandable format using R. I used the ggplot2, dplyr, and plotly packages to put this together.\n\rPutting Together the Plot\rI imported the entire dataset and assigned it to a dataframe (R’s version of, say, an excel table). Using the base R plot() function, I plotted the entire dataframe:\nWithout specifying which variables I want to look at, plot() will output a set of summary plots, with every variable plotted against every other variable. This isn’t great for gathering any meaningful insight, but helps get a “lay of the land” view of the dataframe. In this case, I’m interested in how the percentage of the popular vote a candidate wins is related to the percentage of the electoral vote they win. Using plot(), I can graph popular_vote_pct and electoral_vote_pct variables from the dataframe:\nFigure 2 shows the basic data I want to represent, but there’s a lot of noise. The dataset includes every major candidate in every election since Washington’s run for re-election in 1788. I’m really only interested in the modern two-party system, so I filtered out the elections prior to 1952, as well as any candidate that won 0 electoral votes (i.e., third parties). The new, filtered plot is shown in Figure 3, below:\nNow, with all the data manipulation squared away, I can start with the fun part: making it look good! ggplot’s base plot is, right off the bat, just a bit nicer looking than base R’s plot() function:\nggplot color maps very easily, and with a little googling (aka - jumping through multiple color converters online to convert colors from hexadecimal to rgb to hcl), I was able to make some formatting changes that give the below static chart:\nDespite some frustrations (more on that, below), I was able to add a simple linear regression to the plot, with the shaded bands representing the 95% confidence interval for each regression. Since the Republican regression is above the Democratic regression, the chart implies that, for a given share of popular vote, Republican candidates on average win a larger share of the electoral college than their Democratic counterparts.\nThis finding matches the general consensus and my prior expectations, but I also found something mildly surprising. Ideally, I would imagine, we’d want a candidate’s share of the electoral vote to match their share of the popular vote. However, if I add a reference line of y = x, we can see that both parties tend to underperform in the electoral college when they lose the popular vote, but overperform in the electoral college when they win the popular vote!\nI plotted the absolute vote share from published election results, rather than the two-party vote share (2PV) (i.e., the percentage of vote won if only the top two candidates are considered). Converting to the 2PV would shift the plot to the right, but keep the same overall trend, as Democrats and Republicans have won 100% of the electoral college since 1952. This exercise was more about exploring R’s ggplot() function, so going back into the dataset to account for this marginal change doesn’t seem like an efficient use of time, but I did want to make a note of it, for transparency’s sake.\nFinally, I used the ggplotly() to convert from a static ggplot to an interactive plotly, and exported as an html file. For reasons I’ve yet to figure out, the custom textbox formatting did not want to play nice with the linear regression lines, so I had to take those out. I plan on figuring this wrinkle out eventually, but for now I’m happy with the final plot.

The files I uploaded are, to say the least, in pretty rough shape. That being said, I don’t really plan on tweaking them for this post - I’ve used them as training tools, and it might be interesting in the future to look at the progress I’ve made.\nAlso, I just realized that the interactive plotly chart looks like junk when viewed via mobile (the data points and labels don’t resize automatically). I’ll have to figure out a way to fix this in the future… Maybe I can set the point size as a ratio of the plot width? It’s something to think about, but again, I’m happy with my first run using ggplot \u0026amp; plotly.\n\r","date":1610841600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1610930999,"objectID":"c764a59b339cadbd0f0e6af9abe33efc","permalink":"https://www.thedatadiary.net/blog/2021-01-17-r-ggplot2-plotly/","publishdate":"2021-01-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/2021-01-17-r-ggplot2-plotly/","section":"blog","summary":"Editor’s note: I’ve gone back \u0026amp; read my previous post, \u0026amp; have one general thought - yeeeesh… Everything is so… “matter of fact” in tone \u0026amp; doesn’t really sound like me.","tags":[],"title":"R, ggplot2, \u0026 plotly","type":"blog"},{"authors":[],"categories":["archive"],"content":"\r\rAn Uphill Battle\rToday marks the beginning of what I imagine will be a long journey, with a significant number of hiccups \u0026amp; frustrations along the way.

It has been a long time since I’ve done any sort of stats work (\u0026amp; it was all basic introductory analyses), so I expect an uphill battle with getting my head wrapped around Bayes’ Theorem, Monte Carlo simulations, Brier’s Tests, etc.\rCoding : most of my experience in coding is with VBA - typically just for manipulating data in Excel. I’ve built out a good number of forms using VBA, but don’t typically tend to dig into anything far beyond simple manipulation. The front end of Excel is effectively setup as a visual programming tool, so there’s not a great incentive to do much array manipulation outside of the spreadsheet. Excel is a wonderful tool, \u0026amp; is sufficient for my current job, but I’ve definitely found where its limits lie.
